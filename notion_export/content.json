    "body": "Why is naming always important? In the future, you might need to understand it without having a lexicon. A chair can be named a chair. There is a reason for that. We call communicate without translation.\nAutor: Cincdntg DNL\n![[naming.webp]]\n\n## Perplexity\n\nhttps://www.perplexity.ai/search/easy-to-understand-text-about-8aNYirNBQmyF9IYnPl4G3w\n### The Importance of Naming and Definitions\nNaming and defining things is a fundamental aspect of human communication and understanding. Let’s explore why it’s so crucial in an easy-to-understand way.\n### Why Naming Matters\n1. **Clear Communication**: When we give something a name, we can easily refer to it in conversations. For example, calling a chair a “chair” allows everyone to understand what we’re talking about.\n2. **Shared Understanding**: Names create a common ground for people to discuss ideas, objects, or concepts without confusion.\n3. **Memory Aid**: Names help us remember and categorize things in our minds. It’s easier to recall “chair” than “that thing we sit on with four legs and a back.”\n### The Power of Definitions\n1. **Precision**: Definitions explain what something is, helping to avoid misunderstandings. For instance, a chair is “a separate seat for one person, typically with a back and four legs.”\n2. **Learning**: Good definitions help us learn about new things quickly and accurately.\n3. **Consistency**: When everyone agrees on a definition, it ensures we’re all talking about the same thing.\n### Universal Communication\n1. **Beyond Language Barriers**: Well-chosen names and clear definitions can often transcend language differences. For example, a chair’s function is understood globally, even if the word for it differs.\n2. **Future-Proofing Knowledge**: By naming and defining things clearly, we preserve knowledge for future generations who might not have the same context we do.\n3. **Avoiding Confusion**: Proper naming and definitions reduce the need for constant explanation or translation, making communication more efficient.\n\nIn essence, naming and defining things well is like creating a shared language that helps us understand our world and each other better, both now and in the future.\n\n## Reference\n\nHere are some references to papers and books on the topic of naming and definitions:\nSager, J.

In the real world, there are sometimes only deviations.\nA process also describes HOW we do things, which can differ from the new system you want to buy.\nWhen we say, “First, I do a, then b, then c,” that is how the new system will operate. I think we need to flexibility to say that I need to be able to start with b, go from b to a to c, or add a new step between b and c whenever the market requires it.\nSuppose I split everything to Lego parts and describe WHAT we need to do. And we take, e.g. “register a new customer” If we break that down, one part can be “add customer contact data” and another “add a product/service to the customer. And what is important is that you don’t set them in a specific order. That can be done later.\nThe next requirement is to understand what information we need in each of our Lego blocks. For e.g. CUSTOMER should include”Name, Email, Phone” and is needed in the Lego-block “add customer contact data”.\nIf you look into how systems describe WHAT they can do, it says “Our Capabilities”.\nYour challenge is to describe everything separately first and then try to find suitable parts that fit the whole Capability requirements.\nThis is a true story of how wrong something can be.\nWhen replacing an accounting system for incoming invoices, the process is as follows:\n1.

No fluff, just facts.\nI’m a practical guy. I like models because they help make sense of complicated issues quickly. Business is no different. Some models work, some don’t, and the sooner you figure that out, the better.\n**Here’s the reality:**\n- Some models fail fast.\n- Some models get the job done.\n- Some are just distractions.\n**Why Maps Work**\n\nPeople think in pictures—it’s how we make sense of things. That’s why maps are powerful tools. They help you see connections clearly. Christopher Alexander’s *Pattern Language* talked about this back in 1977. It’s about building blocks and how they fit together—like towns need lakes to have rivers, businesses need the right components connected to succeed.\n\n**Business Is Like LEGO**\n\nThink of your organization like LEGO. Each block has a place, and there are rules on how they connect. No guesswork. I also like models where you can zoom in and out as needed because business problems come in different sizes.\n\nHere’s what you need to focus on at a high level:\n\n- **WHY**: Why are we doing this?\n- **WHAT**: What exactly are we doing?\n- **HOW**: How are we doing it?\n- **WHO**: Who is responsible?\n\nTo me, the **WHAT** is the foundation. Sure, Simon Sinek says “Start with Why,” but that’s not always practical. You need to know **WHAT** you’re doing first.\n\n---\n\n**The Building Blocks of Your Business**\n\nNow, let’s get real. Here’s what we’re working with:\n\n- **Business Models**: What’s the product, service, or strategy?\n- **Capabilities**: What can your company do?\n- **Operating Models**: How does the work actually get done?\n- **Information and Tools**: What resources do you have to support all this?\n\n**So, What’s the WHAT?**\n\nAfter years of trial and error, I always come back to this: **Business Capabilities** explain **WHAT** your company can actually do. Whether it’s logistics, sales, or finance, it’s what you’re equipped to deliver. Sometimes, you’ve got different parts of your organization acting like separate businesses.\n\nFrom this **WHAT**, you answer everything else—why, how, and who.\n\n**Types of Capabilities**:\n\n1. **Strategic Capabilities**: Set the direction—market analysis, planning.\n2. **Core Capabilities**: Define your offering—product development, customer service.\n3. **Supporting Capabilities**: Keep it all running—IT, admin, support.\n\n---\n\n**The Big Picture**\n\nBusiness is about solving real problems people are willing to pay for. Not every problem can be fixed, but they can be managed. That’s where business models come in.\n\nMost organizations are drowning in models that don’t work. You don’t need more; you need the right one. Start with **WHAT** and build from there.\n\n---\n\n**Making the Right Connections**\n\nA lot of businesses miss the link between process and capability. It’s simple:\n\n- **Processes** are about flow—getting things done efficiently.\n- **Capabilities** are about resources—having the tools and people to get the job done.\n\nYou need both. Otherwise, you’re just improving one thing while another part of the business lags behind.\n\n---\n\n**What’s Missing in Your Organization?**\n\nLet’s be honest—you’re probably missing a few building blocks. The **why, what, how,** and **who** aren’t fully aligned, and the connections are weak. I can help you fix that.\n\n**When do we start?**\n\nShoot me a message. Let’s get it done.\n\nWhy should you care about your patterns in the organisation? Because it will give you a better understanding and value in the long term.\nI’m a model guy. I really like good models because they create a faster understanding of a complex issue. The whole business is one of those.\nBut remember that:\nSome models fail faster than others.\nSome models are useful.\nSome bit in working life, I have come to the conclusion that we humans are always trying to imagine things that people say in pictures. If there is a picture it is easier to relate to. That is why I believe maps are a good tool.\nWith all patterns, I want it to be connected. Already in a Pattern Language (from 1977) by Christopher Alexander, he described the basic patterns that are used to build a town. It is basic building blocks and layers of information. In the patterns, he described not only the pattern itself, but also how it is connected and rules how it can be connected. You need a lake to have a river. You can’t have a driveway to the house without some kind of road.\nWith business, it is the same.\n\nYou have building blocks, and like LEGO, and it is possible to connect them with a certain constrains and rules.\nI also like fractal models, where I can zoom in and out.\nOn a very high conceptual level, I see at least four things that need to be connected. It explain what are the things we do.\nWHY, the purpose of the things we do\nWHAT, are the things we doing\nHOW, are we doing things\nWHO, is doing things\nAs you can see, WHAT becomes the backbone of my reasoning.\nSimon Senik famously wrote about this in “Start With Why”. I do not agree that starting with Why is always a good idea. I think trying to figure out WHAT we are doing first is better.\nThe next step of building blocks concerns the disparate things we are discussing.\nBusiness Models, products or services, marketing, strategy, bets.\nOrganisational capability, resources,\nOperating Models, processes, way of working\nInformation and tools.\n\nSo, what is the WHAT in the organisation?\nFrom years of trying different ways, i still circle back to that WHAT is the central thing we can explain the organisation from (some say enterprise just not to lose anyone here)\nBusiness Capability explains what the organisation can do.\nA business capability can be defined as the organisation’s ability to perform unique activities that deliver value, such as logistics, finance, or sales.\nYou can also see the whole organisation as a capability. The Capability to deliver a service or product. And often, we find that we do different things that are separate enterprises within the same organisation.\nFrom the overall capability, we can answer the other questions.\nThere are probably different types of capabilities that can suit your organisation, such as operational capabilities and supporting capabilities. Sometimes, you want to have different strategic capabilities as well.\n1. **Strategic Capabilities**: These set the direction for the organization, including market analysis and planning initiatives.\n2. **Core Capabilities**: These define the organization’s market proposition and include functions like product development, delivery and customer relationship.\n3. **Supporting Capabilities**: These facilitate core functions, such as IT support and administrative services\n\nAnd what is a business mode?\nA business addresses a real problem that someone is willing to pay to get help with. I intentionally wrote help because some problems can’t be solved. They can be mitigated.\n\nSo how can it all be knitted together?\nMost organisations have more models than they need but still miss some that make all the difference.\nI see something in the organisation that can be used as an Anchor Model. One Model to rule them all. And what could be better than to start with WHAT?\n((Image: 1 Capability Maps))\nThe traditional method only has to do with creating boxes and sorting things. But when we add it to the contract with everything else, such as customer journey, information and tools, we realize that the lens of ONLY what we do doesn’t get us all the way.\n((Image: Where it is connected))\n\nHow do you go from strategy to code? Or from product to end user. Or from internal processes to customer satisfaction. All these require different building blocks to be combined.\nI often find that some are missing. The most straightforward example is the difference between process and business capabilities (or business functions).\nThe process (or, nowadays, value flow, value streams) is trying to flow-optimize.\nThe capabilities (or functions) are trying to resource-optimize.\nOptimising becomes true when both aspects are taken into consideration. Otherwise, it is often just sub-optimizing.\n(good bad)\nSo what building blocks do you need?\nThat depends on what you need.\nWhy, what, how, and who are good starts. And my guess is that you are missing at least one of them and that you haven’t glued them together for different purposes.\nSorting that out is what I’m good at, so let me help you with that.\nWhen should we start?\nSend me a DM.\n\nIn the area of trying to explain what a business do there have been a lot of attempts such as Zachmnans Framework for enterprise architecture, Koppler in Operational Processes, BMC, Kottler in marketing, x in change, y in strategy and Meyer Briggs type indicator in personal test.\nSome are aleady outdated. All of them had a purpose in trying to explain something that is abstract. And I would argue that the easiest to understand models are the one that sticks.\nEasy dosent mean that it is uncomplicated. For e.g. Chess is easy to understand how to move the pieces on the board but takes a lifetime to master.\nI have my bag of tools with me when I enter and work in a organisation. For me SImon Sinek really did mess things up for a while but now I just came to understand it better and need to interpetad his words in another context.\nIn his book he starting with Why as a groundwork for every organisations existance.\nAnd that is correct if you understand what Simon means with why.\nI reprase everything as our need to solve things. Task oriented. A problem.\nA definition would be something like:\n\n[[Naming and definitions]]\n\n# References\n\n1. https://unfix.com/blog/try-some-patterns",

    "body": "The Data in the Middle\n\nWe’ve all been there: scrambling to create a report or status update that pulls from scattered data—financial follow-ups, customer projections, layoff plans, and next year’s budget. It’s everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Frustrated, we think, “There’s no tool for this mess, and I’m not doing this again next year.”\n\nThe Default Solution? Excel.\n\nThis Excel file quickly becomes the most critical document in the organization. Everything hinges on it being accurate. But is it?\n\n- Have we evaluated what kind of data we’re using?\n- Can we trust its accuracy?\n- Do we even know who’s changing what?\n- And will this same file be used again?\n\nThese gaps highlight the need for two things:\n\n1. An Operational Model\n2. A System to Manage Data for That Model\n\nWhat’s an Operational Model?\n\nThink of it as the blueprint between strategy and execution. It defines how your organization delivers value to stakeholders, outlining the key components and actions of operations. Today, many operating models are buried in the chaos of scattered Excel files.\n\nWhat Needs to Change?\n\nDefine Your Operational Model: Start by identifying the processes and data that truly matter for delivering value. This step is simpler than it sounds but is often overlooked.\n\nChoose the Right System: You need a system that manages data effectively. Hint: it’s not Excel. For me, Airtable stands out. It connects with other systems, replaces Excel, and creates workflows where updates and automations are seamless.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nFor 2025, my focus is on these two areas: defining clear operational models and leveraging systems that elevate the quality and accessibility of critical data. These steps don’t just clean up chaos - they transform how we work and deliver value with better focus on becoming better.\n\nWhat’s your plan for getting better with the data in the middle?",

But all too often, what that means is unclear. Indeed, in a recent roundtable discussion, few COOs said that they had taken the time to think through and define their agenda.\n\nPart of the reason lies in how people become COOs. Most move into the role from a closely related operations position, making the transition feel less like a change than moving between functions.\n\nBefore starting in a COO role, the new incumbent needs to answer two simple but critical questions:\n\n- Why do we, the organization, have a COO?\n- Why am I, specifically, in the role?\n\nUnderstanding the context of the role is important, particularly the *scope* and the *situation*. The *scope* varies by organization and industry. It could encompass overall responsibility for primary or core operations, as is often seen in heavy industries such as mining or transportation. In financial institutions or holding companies, by contrast, the COO might be responsible for business support functions, such as HR or back-office processes. In other organizations, the COO’s role is akin to that of a president, overseeing business units.\n\nThe *situation* refers to factors in the overall business—or market—driving what needs to happen in operations. A particular business may be undergoing significant transformation, for example, or a period of recovery. At one major retailer, the COO role was established to lead the operations until a designated successor gained more experience and was ready to move into a senior executive role.\n\nThe COO must then understand *why they, themselves, are in the role*. It could be because of a specific skill set or linked to the overall situation, such as Industry 4.0 expertise in the case of digital transformation. Given that more than 25 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs came from the COO role, it could also relate to succession planning.\n\nA particular COO may be selected to balance the strengths of another executive, such as the agribusiness COO whose detailed operational expertise provided a counterweight to a strategic, visionary CEO. The combination helped the company reach new levels of operational excellence.\n\nThe scope and situation illustrate another important point: the COO role is much more than an extension of what the individual was doing before. The job is not just being a “super site manager” who now oversees multiple sites. It is a true C-level role, with a broader view and often new responsibilities.\n\n## Seeing what drives value\n\nThe COO must be crystal clear on what creates distinctive value for the company—hint: it probably isn’t just low cost—while understanding what the strategy means, how operations drives the strategy, and which operational sensitivities will determine the outcomes.\n\nConnecting the cascade of drivers to strategic objectives is essential. A logistics company launched a portfolio of operations initiatives but found that even the most wildly successful ones had little impact on overall results. A mining company worked to raise the performance of individual sites until all showed “green,” only to discover that company-wide operational performance remained “red.” In both cases, the linkages between the overall strategy and operations initiatives were broken—a gap that the COO is best positioned to fill, leading to better prioritization of operations efforts and investments so that they achieve strategic outcomes.\n\n## Setting the COO agenda\n\nThe COO agenda guides COO actions, tests whether investments are being made in the right places, withstands day-to-day firefighting, and helps the COO focus on “COO-only” topics. The core elements of a COO agenda vary by company and context, but in general, the primary elements include:\n\n- **Vision.** Our research found that only 22 percent of employees believe that their leaders have a clear direction for the organization, understand the strategic mandate, and create one if it does not exist.\n- **Plan and execution.** While this step—the “how” of making the vision real—includes near-term operational excellence, it also looks anywhere from six months to three years ahead with a portfolio of initiatives designed for each time frame.\n- **Stakeholder engagement.** One COO we interviewed defined operational excellence as “a full appreciation of the complete set of stakeholders and what their requirements are, including customer, board, public, and employees.” This is a clear COO-only topic, essential to leading operations supporting the business strategy.\n- **Organization and talent.** The COO role is not about running the operation but leading and enabling the operations organization. Experienced COOs have told us to ensure that “the team is in control” and to “find the best team and lean on them.” The COO is responsible for creating the most capable operations organization, including succession planning.\n- **Personal operating model.** The COO role and its responsibilities differ from previous roles and vary from organization to organization. COOs need to manage how they spend their time and attention, lead, and interact with stakeholders.\n\nThese elements will help a COO forge a proactive agenda, make decisions, and prioritize tasks. The perspectives and expectations of core stakeholders—investors, CEOs, and other C-suite executives—should also guide the COO agenda.\n\n## The COO vision begins with the overall business strategy\n\nAn effective operations vision clearly articulates the plan for success and serves as the “true north” for employees across the organization working toward shared goals. To successfully craft the vision and execution plan for operations, the COO must understand the overall business strategy, how operations will drive that strategy, and the role they, as the COO, play in delivering it.\n\nAn enterprise-wide mandate, such as a transformation, business recovery, or shift to digital, can largely shape a COO’s vision. Clearly communicating this vision so that all operators—including those on the front line—can understand and repeat it is crucial. High levels of ownership and buy-in among this group of stakeholders increase the odds of success. If the vision is too complex or fails to resonate among employees, there is little chance of inspiring action.\n\nAn effective vision must be unambiguous, with no room for alternative interpretation. At one financial services company, the vision was expressed as the share of clients engaging through a new channel by the end of the following year. The operational vision of a logistics company was expressed as achieving a consistent capacity above a forecast volume without additional capital investment. There are also times when a qualitative vision and statement of a “leader’s intent”[1Chad Storlie, “Manage uncertainty with commander’s intent,” *Harvard Business Review*, November 3, 2010.](javascript:void(0);) are required. At one transportation provider, the vision entailed achieving a service level that matched its top-performing alternative—but at a lower customer cost.\n\n## A robust plan and effective execution are essential to make the vision a reality\n\nA vision without a *plan* is simply a wish. Time flies, and a host of distractions will hinder progress. A solid plan intertwined with the vision to drive coordinated actions and track progress is essential for moving forward.\n\nThere is nothing magic about the concept of “100 days” and no need to adopt a 100-day plan, but stakeholders expect the COO to act in the near term. The COO’s vision also needs a long-term horizon and a plan to match, albeit with appropriate granular detail.\n\nTo build a robust plan, COOs should assess and act across five areas:\n\n1. **Operations.** What is the current performance and capability? Is the operation aligned with the vision? If not, what will that take to achieve?\n2. **Stakeholders.** What are the expectations of the CEO, chief experience officers (CXOs), boardroom, employees, customers, and other stakeholders?\n3. **Culture.** What is the organization’s culture, and are there changes needed? If so, how can I influence those changes?\n4. **Team.** Are the right team members in the right roles? Does the organizational structure support the operational requirements, particularly regarding the vision?\n5. **Themselves.** What are my strengths? What are my weaknesses? Am I meeting all the requirements of my role?\n\nBy ensuring a thorough understanding across these five areas, the COO can quickly identify and prioritize gaps or challenges, enabling them to act quickly where clear change is necessary. As COOs create and act on a plan, they need a portfolio of initiatives that include the desired impact, challenges to overcome, and a time frame for action. For longer-term initiatives, COOs can implement plans that yield benefits in six months, a year, or longer. As one COO stated in a recent interview, “Time is your friend; invest in capabilities.”\n\nWith a clear vision and plan in place, a COO is well-positioned to *execute* effectively on the business strategy. If running the core of the operation lies within their mandate, the COO also owns operational excellence and will be deeply involved in aligning the company’s operational technology, technical systems, management systems, and organizational principles and behaviors with its purpose and strategy.\n\n“Technical systems” refers to the people, processes, tools, and materials needed to execute the operation. As the one overseeing the nuts and bolts of the operation, the COO must ensure all parts work together to enable the business to deliver on its strategy. This includes not only the “hard” elements of operations, such as equipment, inventory, and logistics, but also elements like data management, digital enablement, and analytics.\n\nManagement systems represent the mechanism for COOs and their teams to monitor and orchestrate operations. COOs need a clear view of the drivers behind desired outcomes, enabling them to monitor and question top-level metrics, as well as the ability to dig deeper into the root drivers.\n\nOrganizational principles and behaviors are equally important. The COO has to set the tone while staying close to the pulse of the culture. The Gemba walk—a classic lean management concept where leaders spend time with employees to see how the work is done—provides a powerful platform to engage with the front line.\n\n## Effectively engaging stakeholders\n\nA COO plays a pivotal role in building relationships for their organization. Fostering connections that last requires care and consideration.\n\nIn modern business, no single element acts alone. As a result, the role and importance of stakeholders have continued to increase. Nowhere is this truer than for the COO. In this role, the COO must look beyond the operation internally and externally and foster productive relationships with a broad group of stakeholders. To do so requires a thorough understanding of and a deliberate approach to each stakeholder’s objectives, incentives, and expectations.\n\nA COO interacts with a broad set of important stakeholders, both internal and external. Each is unique and can often have competing demands that a COO must balance and manage. Several COOs we interviewed stated that they were unprepared for the increased demands of stakeholder engagement and advised new COOs to prepare.\n\n**Key internal stakeholders include the following:**\n\n**The CEO.** The CEO is the most proximate stakeholder, and it is essential to understand the working relationship and expectations. The COO must clearly understand why their role exists in the organization, how the CEO perceives that role, and how best to work together. Often, a COO is selected to complement the CEO’s working style.\n\nThe COO should understand how to collaborate with the CEO effectively. For example: What decisions should the COO take autonomously? What type and depth of information does the CEO want and need for decisions and reassurance? What issues need to be escalated, and how?\n\n**The C-suite.** Nearly all executives we interviewed agreed that increased cross-functional engagement is critical to COO success. The COO is uniquely positioned to help familiarize other C-suite executives with a business’s operations, particularly if those executives have come from another industry. This, however, requires the COO to communicate the “full operational picture,” as one COO described it, including the long-term implications of decisions and investments. Another COO cautioned, “While it is important to teach other leaders about operations, you must also learn to speak their language.” Taking the time to understand others’ objectives and challenges will pay dividends toward fostering genuine collaboration and avoiding disagreements. Among the key C-suite stakeholders are the following:\n\n- **The CFO.** There is tremendous opportunity in closely aligning with the CFO, especially on planning, budgeting, and top-of-mind investor issues such as working capital, large capital expenditures, and productivity. The COO, like the CFO, has a bird’s-eye view of cross-business and cross-functional opportunities. The two can educate each other on best practices in procurement, for example, and even share talent on key short-term projects.\n- **The CMO.** COOs we interviewed noted that the relationship with sales and marketing is particularly important. Operations leaders must thoroughly understand the customer value proposition and what it will take for operations to deliver on it. Furthermore, successful collaboration between marketing and operations functions can help deliver a better customer experience, increasing satisfaction and loyalty.\n- **The CIO.** Technology is at the heart of how we do business today, and the relationship between the COO and CIO, as well as other digital and data leaders, is essential to ensure that operations sees the right return on its investments. Technology investment and deployment present unique opportunities to transform businesses, but this requires deep partnership. For example, daily operations produce an enormous amount of data that, when collaboratively governed and managed, can yield insights that unlock the next S-curve of impact.\n\n**The board.** Board engagement is one area where many COOs expressed dissatisfaction, with some describing board interactions as “scripted presentations.” The best CEOs use the collective experience of the entire board to help solve problems or give advice. Several COOs encouraged seeking this kind of relationship, ensuring that their exposure to and engagement with the board consisted of focused meetings and problem-solving sessions versus presentations.\n\n**Key external stakeholders include the following:**\n\nRegulators, suppliers, organized labor, investors, and others are important, but the final and perhaps ultimate external stakeholder is the customer.\n\nThe COO is the operational link to the strategy, so they should know the market. At least one executive we interviewed strongly believes that every COO, whether new to the organization or coming up from within, should have market-facing experience. This helps when collaborating with the marketing function and provides the COO the ability to factor customer experience early into any decisions.\n\nStakeholder engagement is a COO-only topic that is essential to operational excellence in support of the strategy. COOs who prioritize key stakeholders (for example, those with the ability to influence the success or failure of the plan) and are thoughtful in how they engage them have a far greater likelihood of success than those who don’t.\n\n## Building organizational and talent excellence\n\nAround 70 percent of corporate transformations fail. Some of the most common reasons cited for transformation efforts that fail to achieve their full potential are related to organizational culture, mindsets, capabilities, and talent. The COO plays a critical role in ensuring the right infrastructure is in place and establishing a leadership-oversight cadence to drive mindsets and behaviors to execute the business strategy successfully.\n\nIn most organizations, the COO is not expected to run the day-to-day operations but to focus on the more strategic aspects of operations to enable the overall business strategy. For rising COOs, this can be a difficult transition; indeed, too often, it leads to failure. Successful COOs do not act as “super site managers” but rather rely on their team to handle the day-to-day. In our COO interviews, this was a recurring theme: “The team is in control,” “Find the best team and lean on them,” and “Set it [the operations] up to run without you.”\n\nOur research found three key ways that successful COOs navigate strategy around organizational infrastructure and talent.\n\n**Ensure the right frontline leadership.** Strong teams are led by strong managers. In *Power to the Middle: Why Managers Hold the Keys to the Future of Work* (Harvard Business Review Press, 2023), frontline (middle) managers are referred to as the “true center of the organization and its most valuable asset,” as they possess the granular knowledge, direct influence, and perspective necessary to effectively lead any operational realignments (for example, change initiatives or digital disruption).\n\nCOOs should place special focus on assessing their organization and talent. This begins by distinguishing what skills and capabilities are needed to execute the operational plan and then partnering closely with HR and senior leaders to find and develop the people accordingly. While it is important for the COO to work in close partnership with HR and other senior leaders, it is imperative that they own the outcome: the successful placement of top talent in critical roles.\n\nOnce the right team is in place, the COO should ensure they remain high-performing through capability building, performance management, mentoring, and coaching. Additionally, the COO should ensure that detailed succession planning is in place—for the COO role as well as other leadership roles in operations. However, those who do not aspire to senior leadership should not be overlooked as they are often the heroes of the operations—[good managers should often be given higher-value compensation instead of being promoted out of their jobs](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/middle-managers-are-the-heart-of-your-company).[2Emily Field, Bryan Hancock, and Bill Schaninger, “](javascript:void(0);)[Middle managers are the heart of your company](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/middle-managers-are-the-heart-of-your-company),” *McKinsey Quarterly,* July 17, 2023.\n\n**Be clear about your intentions.** As an operations leader, a COO should give deliberate thought to how they will lead. One effective concept is that of a leader’s intent. Adapted from the military concept of commander’s intent,[3“Manage uncertainty with commander’s intent,” November 3, 2010.](javascript:void(0);) leader’s intent can be incredibly effective in a distributed operation. It provides the ultimate objective, not prescriptive decisions, so that in a situation filled with ambiguity and requiring an urgent and autonomous decision, the distributed operator will make decisions that are consistent with the COO’s intent. They will not get it right 100 percent of the time, but in most situations, the operator makes the right decision (and often a decision that no one previously imagined but that has a significant positive impact).\n\nThe COO must also recognize the impact of their behaviors and actions. At one organization, for instance, leaders wanted to see a shift in focus in asset maintenance toward productivity to ensure that maintenance tasks of all sizes and scope were performed in an efficient manner. On the daily operations call, the leaders asked questions about jobs completed. In response, the team began tackling small jobs to maintain a high number of completed jobs while larger jobs were sidelined. The questions asked by leaders inadvertently drove frontline behaviors that created a maintenance “debt” across the organization’s assets, diminishing overall asset health. This example reinforces how important it is for COOs to model what is important (in other words, framing questions in a way that drives specific, intended outcomes) and provide reinforcement mechanisms, both positive and negative, for operators.\n\nLastly, the COO must consider how they amplify. The clear articulation of strategy is a key pillar of success, but stakeholders may find their own source of meaning through personal, company, or team success or impact on the customer or society. Therefore, COOs should amplify all of these elements to ensure that success feels shared across the organization. In fact, previous studies have shown that each of these is a common source of meaning and roughly equally distributed among the population. Few people in operations are likely to share the same source of meaning. Therefore, if the COO only communicates in terms of their own source of meaning, they are likely missing the majority of the population.\n\n**Be deliberate in how you influence.** One COO described the role as being about leading change—“You have to be comfortable making people uncomfortable,” also noting, “You need to proactively manage the inertia of the organization,” calling attention to the inherent tendency of an organization to keep moving in its current or historical direction. As a change leader, the COO can deploy many influence techniques. For example, they can be an inspirational leader who convinces the organization of the value of change. They can be the expert, teaching and enabling others. They can influence through incentives, both carrots and sticks. Or they can be a role model, setting the example as an operational leader.\n\nWhile each of these approaches increases the probability of success in leading change, a McKinsey study found that successful transformations were almost eight times as likely to employ all four approaches (exhibit). However, most organizations default to one technique, communications. By failing to address the other influence factors, particularly incentives and role modeling, an organization risks experiencing competing influences, which can lead to failure. For example, if a COO communicates a new way of working but does not change incentives from rewarding the previous operating model, change is unlikely.\n\n[](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/operations/our%20insights/delivering%20the%20strategy%20the%20coo%20agenda/svgz-coo-agenda-ex1-v2.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\n\nGiven their unique role relative to other operations leaders, a COO benefits greatly from stepping back and thinking through how best to organize their team to drive outcomes, develop the talent required, and be clear about the role they will play in leading operations.\n\n## Establishing a personal operating model\n\nOne sentiment widely shared across COOs we interviewed was that a COO’s role and expectations are different than “what got you here.” Being COO is different from other operations roles. Stakeholders are not looking for the COO to be a “super site manager” or a version of the COO’s previous role with just a larger scope. COOs are expected to hand off and delegate running the operation and focus on COO-only and strategic topics, many of which were not part of their previous role.\n\nUsing a basketball analogy, one COO describes it as the need to “lean into your left hand,” meaning to improve shooting with your nondominant hand. For the COO role, this means becoming stronger in areas outside your core expertise.\n\nFor example, in business case analysis, the COO is often the owner of pitching to the CEO or CFO for major operations investments. Reviewing, explaining, and often asking hard questions of their own staff become important skills. Another COO reflects that in his previous role, he was a great operator and site leader. However, his new COO role includes collaborating on core ERP systems and advanced manufacturing technology, requiring him to learn much more about technology quickly.\n\nSuccessful COOs find a balance between running the operation and delivering strategic outcomes, but that doesn’t happen by accident. COOs need to be deliberate in establishing their personal operating model, clearly defining the role they will—and won’t—play in operations leadership. This allows them to be structured and intentional in how they spend their time and energy to ensure a focus on COO-only and strategic topics.\n\n### Be clear about the role you will play\n\nFor many COOs, this means shifting working methods to expand capacity for COO-only topics. COOs should be clear about their priorities and personal leadership focus and limit their involvement in tasks that others can deal with. Where a COO should engage will vary based on scope, situation, and mandate.\n\nCOOs should know their strengths but be honest about their limitations and strategically align talent to bridge any gaps toward delivering the vision. This can increase personal efficiency and effectiveness and create succession planning and development opportunities. Familiarity with other functional areas will serve the COO well as they look to improve collaboration.\n\n### Create an actionable plan and stick to it\n\nCOOs should have a clear view of areas that will require more of their focus and ensure the right mechanisms are in place to make it happen. For those COO-only topics, this means identifying and outlining the cadence for critical interactions. They should be clear on what data and reports they need to see, at what level, and how frequently.\n\nIn thinking through delegation, they should consider their level of involvement in delivering operational excellence and determine where direct leadership is required. For example, COOs can achieve high ROI from their time by strategically conducting site visits, both in terms of their personal learning and providing visible leadership, mentoring, and role modeling at the front line.\n\n### Lead to inspire talent and shape the culture\n\nCOOs should move beyond a vertical hierarchy and, instead, see themselves as catalysts and connectors to drive empowerment and collaboration. The result is high-performing teams, operating in a culture of trust and human connection that extends past formal structures.\n\n### Proactively manage your time and energy\n\nCOOs tell us that effective time management is a frequent challenge. Some say it is perhaps the biggest challenge of all—being able to focus on the right topics at the level of depth required. As a general rule of thumb, several COOs offer that no more than a third of their time should be spent on running the operation. The rest of their time should be spent on COO-only topics such as strategy, governance, transformation, people/talent, and organizational health.\n\nDay-to-day firefighting can feel like a constant demand-pull for COOs. A COO who is reactive risks focusing only on the near term and making decisions based on experience, heuristics, and gut feelings. Stepping back instead and making data-based decisions with a strategic versus reactive view will help the COO stay ahead.\n\nTo maximize time spent on critical areas, COOs need to embed a steady rhythm—for example, how they manage their year/month/week, workflow, and travel schedule. This can be codified and communicated with the operations team and reinforced through the COO’s assistant. Meeting archetypes should be predefined, as should how meetings are run, including preparation expectations. Free capacity should be actively built in to protect time for long-term needs, including critical priorities and energy maximizers.\n\nSchedule activities to prevent “energy troughs” and make room for recovery activities such as time with family and friends and exercise. COOs should be comfortable and confident in setting boundaries. This ensures they set a pace they can sustain for a marathon-length effort rather than burn out from repeated sprints.\n\nToday’s most effective COOs have a defined agenda that is aligned with the overall business strategy, focusing on how operations can drive that strategy and what role they will play in delivering results. The COO agenda lays out the operational vision of an effective organization, clearly articulates a plan for success, and serves as a North Star for employees working together toward shared goals.\n\nSuccessful COOs drive effective collaboration and engagement with all key stakeholders to fully drive their agenda and deliver the business strategy. They are inspirational leaders and role models who are also methodical in building a team to which they can delegate day-to-day operations, allowing them to focus on COO-only topics and determine where and how to spend their time best to deliver the highest impact for the organization.\n\n[**Darryl Piasecki**](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/darryl-piasecki) is the managing partner of McKinsey’s St. Louis office.\n\n### Explore a career with us\n\n[Search Openings](https://www.mckinsey.com/careers/search-jobs)",

Campbell och Simonton beskrev kreativitet som en evolutionär urvalsprocess där **slump och variation är avgörande**.\n\nLiane Gabora har i sin “honing theory” visat att kreativa idéer snarare växer fram som gradvisa omstruktureringar av en mental representation, inte som en sekventiell pipeline.

Några år slutade den illusionen vid en flygplats i London 2014.\n\n### **Andra som ha givit en hint**\n\n> “The creative process is a process of surrender, not control.” \n- Julia Cameron\n> \n\n> “The creative process is not controlled by a switch you can simply turn on or off; it’s with you all the time.” \n- Alvin Ailey\n> \n\nAtt försöka detaljstyra blir kontraproduktivt. Organisationen skapar falsk trygghet och tappar konkurrenskraft.\n\n### **Slutsats**\n\nDen som vill ha resultat måste ge förutsättningar. Sätt ramar. Klargör syftet. Beskriv vilken förmåga (eller funktion) som ska aktiveras. Beskriv *vad* som ska göras. Men lämna vägen dit, *hur*, åt de som kan sitt hantverk.\n\nFör kreativitet hör inte bara hemma i modehus och innovationslabb. Även inköp, kundtjänst och administration behöver utrymme för att människor ska kunna tänja på formen, pröva nytt och förvandla bra till fantastiskt. Det är så organisationer blir levande och det är så man är fortsatt en kraft att räkna med. Många skriver innovation med massa mumbojumbo. Men kreativitet är hjärtat av allt.\n\nJohn Cleese sa det bra:\n\n> Vet du vad den största fienden mot kreativitet är?\nDet är att du inte tillåts göra fel.\n> \n\n[John Cleese on Creativity In Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g)\n\nDet bästa är om kreativitet och nyfikenhet blir en del av er kultur på riktigt oavsett vad processen säger att den hör hemma.",

    "body": "How to Make Your Next Team Review Useful\nLet’s be real—most post-project reviews can feel like a blame game. But they don’t have to! Here’s a better way to approach it with three easy questions that can lead to real improvements:\n\n1. What Went Well?\nStart with the positives: “What went well, and how can we do that again?”\nIt’s easy to jump straight into what went wrong, but first, let’s celebrate the wins. If something worked, let’s make sure we don’t forget it next time!\n2. What Didn’t Go Well?\nNext, it’s time for some constructive feedback: “What didn’t go so well, and what did we learn from it?”\nNo one’s perfect, and that’s fine. But let’s focus on what we can learn instead of just pointing fingers. The goal is to avoid making the same mistakes again.\n3. What Should We Do Differently Next Time?*\nFinally, let’s look ahead: “What can we tweak to make things run even smoother next time?”\nThis is where we take the lessons from what went well and what didn’t and turn them into new ideas for improvement. It’s all about getting better, not staying stuck. Remember that improvement is better than perfect.\n\nThese three simple questions keep things positive and productive. Plus, they help avoid those awkward blame moments we all dread if you look at what we have learned.\nDid I miss anything? 👇\n\nThree very easy questions to ask yourself in the middle and after something has happened:\n1. What Went Well?\n2. What Didn’t Go Well?\n3. What would be our new Standards?\nBy asking your team these questions and asking them to write a few words and read them out loud at the beginning of a meeting, you can neutrally get into what we can change and make better next time.\n\nStep 1: What Went Well\n\nWe begin every AAR by asking this question:\n\n“What replicable new learning did we gain from what went well?”\nIn any post-mortem, our brains can naturally focus on what went wrong. However, it is critical to get clear on what went RIGHT so the good can be repeated.\n\n—\n\nStep 2: What Didn’t Go Well\n\nAfter reviewing what went well and the successes we can repeat in the future, we move on to constructive criticism.\n\nWe frame the discussion with a similar question:\n\n“What replicable new learning did we gain from what did not go well?”\n\nNotice - the question isn’t asking what went wrong… specifically what is the new LESSON we can incorporate for the future.\n\n—\n\nStep 3: New Standards\n\nOnce we’ve dissected the lessons from what went well and what didn’t, we turn our focus to the future.\n\nCombining the insights from the first two steps, we assess the following::\n\n“Drawing upon questions 1 and 2, what changes can we make to our processes to systematically improve our consistent tactical excellence?”\n\nThis reinforces that the standard is excellence, clear process is how we get there, and asks what improvements to our process move us ahead?\n# References\n1.

My first job was to create informationsmaps for cities in Sweden finances by small ads 5x5 cm. A lot of them :-) At the time we only created printed versions in end of 1990.

The purpose of this map was to help Cesare Borgia, son of Pope Alexander VI and marshal of the papal troops, become more aware of the town’s layout for defence.\n\nThe type is a concept of [ichnographic](https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/geoglyphs/) maps that was developed by the Roman architect Vitruvius to describe the art of drawing realistic ground plans. A simplification.\n\n## Maps of today\n\nIf you use Leonardo Da Vincis 500 year old map you can still walk around in the center of old town and navigate with it.\n\nThe Iconograpic is what we are used to see the world as today.\n\n![[Untitled 2 4.png|Untitled 2 4.png]]\n\nBut it is just a simplification. The truth is much more complex.\n\n![[Untitled 3 4.png|Untitled 3 4.png]]\n\nBut that doesn’t help you most of the time.\nA flat representation does.\n\n## Single point of truth\n\nWe belive that you need a map to be able to navigate in your organisation or enterprise. And what is most important is that this map becomes single point of truth and adding transparency in your work.\n\nWhat is true is that everyone dosen’t like this! If people in the organisation are used to work in the shadows without anyone else knowing what they do, how they do it and what purpose they have a map wont be their friend. A map will bring clarity and some order. It will help change.

En klassiker. De hade byggt något “intelligent” med AI, automation och realtidsanalys. En adaptiv plattform, som det så fint hette.\n\nJag bad dem förklara sin produkt.\n\n“AI-driven automation, prediktiv analys, en adaptiv plattform med machine learning och realtidsinsikter riktade mot customer engagement.”\n\nJag sa: “Okej… men vad är det riktiga problem ni försöker lösa? För vem?”\n\nDå kom svaret jag ofta hör: “Alltså, kunden behöver ju bara ett smartare system. Det är ju det som är grejen.” Egentligen säger de inte exakt det, men det är vad de egentligen säger.\n\nJag förklarade att det där inte är ett problem. Det är en lösning. Eller rättare sagt: det är buzzword bingo. Jag frågade inte vad tekniken hette. Jag frågade vad kunden har för problem?\n\nDe fortsatte. “Men det är ju AI! Det är framtiden!”\n\nOch där någonstans fick jag säga det som vi måste säga oftare:\n\n“Som jag ser det löser du ett hitte-på-problem. Och du vet inte heller vem kunden är.”\n\nTystnad. Sedan: “Så du menar alltså att vi bara fluffar runt?”\n\nJag svarade: “Ja. Fast dyrt. Med investerarnas pengar.”\n\nDet blev tyst igen. Och sen, lite oväntat.\n\n“Okej. När kan du börja jobba med oss då?”\n\nDet här händer oftare än man tror, att någon inte riktigt vet vilket problem de ska lösa. Däremot händer det inte så ofta att en CEO får höra sanningen.\n\nMin poäng är: Mina kunder är inte dumma, bara lite vilse ibland. De saknar ofta någon som säger ifrån. Som vågar kalla det för vad det är, fluff. Hitte-på. Teknik utan behov.\n\nI Startup-världen är det enkelt. Om du inte kan peka ut vem som har ett riktigt problem, och hur det påverkar deras vardag, så har du inte ett företag. Du har en PowerPoint med feature-listor.\n\nOch det är inget att bygga på.\n\nDet borde inte du göra heller, även om du inte driver en startup.",

Often there is no one that is responsible to overseeing it from end-to-end.\nI have come to the conclusion that what is to often broken is the information and systems that is actually drivning the organisation.\nThere is stable ground in our core systems, such as ERP and CRM, from vendors like SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, or IBM.\nBut between that and the strategy in Power Point there is just an unstructure mess of Excels. And more Power Points. And on top of that some Process Description that is made by one of the big 4.\n\nI think it is in this middle where you can make all the difference.\n5 years ago, the NoCode weren’t so Enterprise ready. But boy, is it now! You would need a stack of tools that can create that efficient workflow and optimized processes. And one tool is sticking out more than all others.\nAirtable.\nIt can be the central for all data used for operational management.\nIt can connect to for e.g. SAP, Salesforce and pretty much anything else. Even an Excel file :-)\nIn the transition from 1 000 of Excel-files that stears the organisation you need to take it piece by piece. Have a initial thoughts on how to do this with the basics of information and process mapping. Then iterate. One Excel at the time. One workflow at the time.\nAnd here is the thing. It needs to be super-adaptive to change. What we know after 5 excel isn’t the same as after 100.\nSo make the transition from a unefficient way of working to something that gives you and true advantage and start trusting your data again.\n\nOn tool to rule them all\n\nA large problem in organisations is a lack of ownership of enterprise alignment. There is no one overseeing the enterprise from end-to-end.\n\nRemove your Excel Nightmare: Find a replacement for middle management Tools.\nEnterprise alignment is often hindered by a need for more transparency and accountability, particularly across the systems and data that drive decision-making. Many organizations have a stable core - ERP and CRM systems - but a messy middle filled with disconnected Excel files and scattered PowerPoints.\nThe real opportunity lies in fixing this chaotic middle. Here’s is an idea for you:\nFocus on Data Transparency\n→ Ensure all data that drives decisions is easily accessible and trustworthy.\nUse NoCode Tools\n→ Modern NoCode solutions, like Airtable, are now enterprise-ready and can fill the gaps.\nConnect Systems Seamlessly\n→ Integrate Airtable with ERP, CRM, and even legacy tools like Excel.\nAdopt Incremental Changes\n→ Move from all your excel-files by iterating one file, one workflow at a time.\nStay flexible\n→ Build systems that can change and evolve often; what you know today isn’t the same as what you know in a few months.\n\nTo achieve alignment, you need a system that is flexible and transparent. Airtable can be your central hub, connecting disparate data sources and driving operational efficiency. Start replacing the Excel chaos piece by piece, transform it into a reliable system, and trust the data again for better and faster decisions. \nWhen it comes around, it is the decision we need to be better at.",

Det står i nästan varje strategidokument numera. “Vi ska bli datadrivna.”\n\nMen vad betyder det egentligen?\n\nFör många betyder det: vi köper ett nytt verktyg, samlar in ännu mer data, dumpar allt i en data lake, och hoppas att någon hittar något användbart. Som att spela “finns i sjön” med hela organisationens beslut.\n\nMen oftast händer inget. För man har glömt det viktigaste: vilket problem försöker vi faktiskt lösa?\n\n## Några punkter mot att bli datadriven, som ger resultat\n\n1. Börja med något som skaver\n\nDet finns nästan alltid något som skaver i verksamheten. En flaskhals. Något som tar för lång tid. Något som borde gå att förklara men som alla bara “känner på sig”.\n\nDär ska man börja. Inte i framtiden, utan i nuet. Inte i visionen, utan i vardagen.\n\nExempel: Varför halkar vi efter i leveranser? Varför tappar vi kunder efter onboarding? Varför tar vissa beslut så lång tid?\n\nNär du har en konkret fråga, då har du något att undersöka.\n\n1. Hitta relevant data\n\nDå först är det dags att prata data. Inte all data. Inte “vi borde mäta allt”. Utan: vilken data kan hjälpa oss förstå just det här problemet bättre?\n\nDet kan vara siffror. Det kan vara mönster. Det kan vara loggar, samtal, e-post, kundärenden, excelfiler. Det behöver inte vara perfekt. Det behöver bara vara tillräckligt för att börja dra en slutsats.\n\n1. Testa. Misslyckas. Lär dig.\n\nSen testar man. Kanske hittar man inget. Kanske hittar man något. Man försöker se samband. Prövar hypoteser. Pratar med folk. Gör fel. Får nya idéer.\n\nDet är inte särskilt digitalt. Det är bara vanligt arbete. Skillnaden är att man jobbar med verkligheten, inte med gissningar.\n\n1. Och viktigast av allt. Berätta!\n\nNär man väl hittar något som funkar, är det lätt att gå vidare till nästa grej.\n\nMen här är ett bättre råd: stanna upp. Skriv ner det. Visa hur ni tänkte. Berätta vad ni såg. Vad ni ändrade. Vad resultatet blev.\n\nBerätta det som en story. För andra i organisationen. För chefer. För nya team. För er själva.\n\nFör det är så man bygger kultur. Inte med dashboards, utan med en story.\n\n1. Och så gör ni om det\n\nNästa gång är det lite lättare. Någon annan i organisationen tänker: “Hmm, kan vi kolla på datat innan vi gissar?”\n\nOch nästa gång igen är det kanske någon som ber om hjälp med att tolka ett mönster.\n\nEfter ett tag har något förändrats. Folk börjar leta efter orsaker, inte symtom. De börjar fråga efter data, inte efter mer magkänsla.\n\nDå har ni börjat bli datadrivna. Inte för att ni sa det, utan för att ni visade det.\n\n---\n\nLinkedIn\n\nDatadriven kultur börjar inte med data. Den börjar med ett problem.\n\nDet är lätt att säga att man vill bli datadriven. Det låter modernt. Strategiskt. Rätt.\n\nSå man köper ett verktyg, samlar mer data, sätter upp dashboards och väntar på förändring.\n\nMen ingenting händer. För man har inte börjat i rätt ände (den här gången heller).\n\nVill ni bli datadrivna på riktigt?\n\nBörja i det som skaver. Det ni inte riktigt förstår. Det ni mest gissar kring.\n\nOch bygg därifrån.\n\nLäs artikeln: Datadriven kultur börjar inte med data.

Unlike technical debt, which primarily focuses on software development challenges, enterprise debt affects the entire organization and its ability to adapt and innovate[1].\n\n## Key Aspects of Enterprise Debt\n\n**Types of Enterprise Debt:**\n- Process debt: Inefficient or outdated processes that slow down operations\n- People debt: Skill gaps or misaligned talent within the organization\n- Technology debt: Outdated or incompatible systems across the enterprise\n- Cultural debt: Resistance to change or lack of innovation mindset\n\n**Impact on the Organization:**\nEnterprise debt can lead to decreased productivity, increased costs, and reduced competitiveness in the market[1]. It often manifests as a struggle to implement new technologies or adapt to changing business environments.\n\n## Managing Enterprise Debt\n\n**Assessment and Identification:**\n- Conduct a comprehensive audit of processes, systems, and skills across the organization\n- Identify areas of inefficiency, redundancy, or misalignment with business goals\n\n**Prioritization:**\n- Evaluate the impact and urgency of each identified debt\n- Create a roadmap for addressing the most critical issues first\n\n**Debt Reduction Strategies:**\n- Implement agile methodologies to improve processes and adaptability\n- Invest in employee training and development to address skill gaps\n- Modernize technology infrastructure and systems\n- Foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation\n\n**Long-term Mitigation:**\n- Establish governance structures to prevent the accumulation of new debt\n- Regularly review and update processes, technologies, and skills\n- Encourage cross-functional collaboration to break down silos\n\nBy addressing enterprise debt holistically, organizations can improve their agility, efficiency, and ability to innovate in an ever-changing business landscape[1].\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://youtu.be/jeLfFCVElgU",

Inconsistent work quality\n2. Difficulty in scaling operations\n3. Inefficient communication\n4. Lack of accountability\nWithout proper processes, employees may struggle to understand expectations, leading to confusion and reduced productivity.**Too Much Process**On the other hand, excessive processes can be equally detrimental:\n1. Stifled creativity and innovation\n2. Decreased employee autonomy\n3. Slower decision-making\n4. Increased bureaucracy\nOveremphasis on process can lead to a culture where following procedures becomes more important than achieving results.",

    "body": "Stephen Covey, success-by-pattern gurus.\nHis book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\n1. Be proactive.\n2. Begin with the end in mind. (Imagine a good outcome.)\n3. Put first things first. (Set priorities.)\n4. Think win-win. (Don’t be greedy.)\n5. Seek first to understand then be understood.\n6. Synergize. (Use teamwork.)\n7. Sharpen the saw. (Keep learning.)\nSure thing! Here’s a more detailed summary of Stephen Covey’s “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,” with an expansion on each of the habits:\n\n1. **Be Proactive**\n    \n    This habit emphasizes taking responsibility for your life. Instead of reacting to external circumstances, you focus on what you can control and influence. It’s about being proactive in how you choose your responses, leading to more empowered outcomes.\n    \n2. **Begin with the End in Mind**\n    \n    Covey encourages you to envision what you want to achieve before you begin any task or journey. This habit is about setting a clear vision of your goals, values, and principles to guide your actions, ensuring that your efforts align with your ultimate purpose.\n    \n3. **Put First Things First**\n    \n    Prioritization is key to effectiveness. This habit urges you to focus on what’s truly important, not just what’s urgent. By managing your time according to your values and priorities, you ensure that your actions contribute to long-term success rather than just reacting to immediate demands.\n    \n4. **Think Win-Win**\n    \n    Effective relationships are built on mutual benefit. This habit focuses on finding solutions that satisfy both parties, fostering a mindset of abundance rather than competition. When you strive for “win-win” outcomes, you create sustainable partnerships that are beneficial for everyone involved.\n    \n5. **Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood**\n    \n    Communication is more effective when you first seek to understand others before expressing your own perspective. This habit is about practicing empathetic listening to genuinely grasp others’ needs and concerns, which builds trust and lays a foundation for meaningful dialogue.\n    \n6. **Synergize**\n    \n    This habit is all about collaboration. It’s the idea that combining the strengths of people can lead to outcomes greater than the sum of individual contributions. Synergy leverages diverse perspectives and talents to create innovative solutions that wouldn’t be possible alone.\n    \n7. **Sharpen the Saw**\n    \n    Covey concludes with the importance of self-renewal in four areas: physical, mental, social, and spiritual. By regularly “sharpening the saw,” you maintain your effectiveness and prevent burnout. This habit is about continuous growth and maintaining balance in your life for sustained success.\n    \n\nThese habits are designed to transform how you approach both personal and professional challenges, focusing on character growth, building meaningful relationships, and achieving goals through a principled approach.",

    "body": "![[Pasted image 20240823220119.png]]\n\nComposable Business Capabilities (CBCs) are a key concept in building flexible and modular enterprise architectures. Here’s more information and background on this approach:\n\n## Definition and Concept\n\nComposable Business Capabilities (CBCs) are modular, self-contained units of business functionality that can be assembled, disassembled, and reassembled to create new business processes or applications[1]. They are the building blocks of a composable enterprise architecture, allowing organizations to quickly adapt to changing business needs and market conditions.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\nCBCs have several important characteristics:\n\n1. **Modularity**: Each CBC is a discrete unit of business functionality that can operate independently[1].\n2. **Interoperability**: CBCs are designed to work together seamlessly, allowing for easy integration and recombination[4].\n3. **API-driven**: CBCs typically expose their functionality through well-defined APIs, enabling easy communication and integration with other components[2].\n4. **Business-oriented**: CBCs are aligned with specific business outcomes or use cases, making them meaningful to business users as well as technical teams[3].\n\n## Benefits of Using CBCs\n\nImplementing Composable Business Capabilities offers several advantages:\n\n1. **Increased Agility**: Organizations can quickly assemble new business processes or applications by combining existing CBCs[1].\n2. **Improved Scalability**: Individual CBCs can be scaled up or down as needed, without affecting the entire system[3].\n3. **Enhanced Innovation**: The modular nature of CBCs allows for rapid prototyping and experimentation with new business models or services[2].\n4. **Better Resilience**: Isolating functionality in CBCs minimizes the risk of system-wide failures[3].\n\n## Creating Microservices with CBCs\n\nWhen using CBCs to create microservices:\n\n1. **Identify Business Functions**: Break down complex business processes into smaller, discrete functions that can be encapsulated as CBCs[3].\n2. **Define APIs**: Create clear, well-documented APIs for each CBC to facilitate integration and communication[2].\n3. **Ensure Independence**: Design each CBC to be independently deployable and scalable[1].\n4. **Consider Data Management**: Determine how data will be shared and managed between CBCs, often using event-driven architectures[2].\n\n## Role of APIs in CBCs\n\nAPIs play a crucial role in Composable Business Capabilities:\n![[Pasted image 20241013002602.png]]\n1. **Technical Communication**: APIs provide the technical means for CBCs to interact with each other and with external systems[2].\n\n1. **Interaction Agreements**: APIs define the contract for how different components should communicate, including data formats and protocols[2].\n2. **Flexibility**: APIs allow for ad-hoc communication between CBCs, enabling dynamic composition of business processes[4].\n\nBy leveraging Composable Business Capabilities and well-designed APIs, organizations can create flexible, modular architectures that enable rapid adaptation to changing business needs and foster innovation.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://www.bluestonepim.com/blog/packaged-business-capabilities\n[2] https://mia-platform.eu/blog/packaged-business-capabilities-pbc/\n[3] https://sageitinc.com/blog/packaged-business-capabilities-composable-businesses\n[4] https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/composable-business\n[5] https://quixy.com/blog/composable-business-101-everything-you-need-to-know/\n[6] https://www.tietoevry.com/en/blog/2023/09/composable-architecture-exploring-business-design-and-architecture-of-the-future/\n[7] https://www.trisotech.com/composability-and-packaged-business-capabilities/\n[8] https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable\n\nUsing BC to create a composable Business Capability that can be used for creating a “microservice” of a function.\nAPI:s are:\nAPI:s for technical communication\nAgreements for how to interact\nAd hoc - communication\n\nModular Business Capabilities\nInteroperable Business Capabilities\n\n![[CleanShot 2024-08-23 at 21.47.06@2x.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20240823220347.png]]\n## Reference\n[https://www.capstera.com/business-capabilities-determine-microservices/](https://www.capstera.com/business-capabilities-determine-microservices/)\nhttps://solace.com/blog/event-driven-architecture-gartner-composable-business/",

Om vi har en kultur där det inte finns ett erkännande att hela verksamheten är en organism (eller systematiskt tänkt behövs) så uppstår oundvikligen silos.\n\n(Video om när han pratar om systematik)\n\nEtt första steg är att du förstår vilka drivkrafter som skapar silos?\n\nMånga påstår att det är för att skydda sin makt och position. Men det är inte min bild. Jag menar att de flesta har tagit sig till en position genom ett slit i att försöka förstå sin del av organisation och har all intention att göra den bättre. I det här arbetet skapar man sig oundvikligen sin bild hur organisationen som stort ska drivas framåt, utan att den för delen är synkad med andra. Anledningen att det inte är synkad är det finns inte ett sätt att göra det. Enligt mig är här verksamhetsarkitektur kommer in.\n\nVad är då verksamhetsarkitektur? En enkel definition skulle kunna vara:\n\n> Det är en beskrivning av en verksamhets struktur i termer av dess mål, förmågor, processer, information, organisation och resurser – med syfte att skapa en gemensam förståelse för hur verksamheten fungerar och kan utvecklas.\n> \n\nMen ordet verksamhetsarkitektur är abstrakt och jag gillar inte abstrakt. Så försök komma överens om ett ord ni använder för att beskriva er verksamhet. Några förslag:\n\nVad vi gör, vårt sätt att jobba, hur vi hänger ihop, vårt operativsystem, vår spelplan, så här gör vi saker, vår inre karta, det som håller ihop oss, vårt maskineri eller vår systematik. Kommer skriva **vår systematik** framåt.\n\n## Vad vi gör\n\nEn av mina favoriter att jobba med för att förklara en verksamhet är vad vi gör. Ett exempel att beskriva verksamheten är då att beskriva vad:et.\n\n1. Hantera kundförfrågningar.\n2. Skapa och hantera offert.\n3. Boka arbetet.\n4. Utföra arbetet.\n5. Fakturera arbetet.\n\nDessa beskrivningar är fritt vad avdelningar heter utan utgår gärna från vad kunden vill göra och få uträttat. Ibland kallas detta för verksamhetsförmågor eller funktioner. Men det är en religion i sig så vi lämnar det.\n\nNästa steg är att försöka förstå vilka beroende som finns mellan varandra.\n\n“Skapa och hantera offert” lämnar en godkänd offert inklusive vad som ska utföras till “Utföra arbetet”. Då kan man börja fundera på vilken överenskommelse finns däremellan? Vad måste offerten innehålla? Produkt, kontaktpersonens telefonnummer, adress dit vi behöver åka, vad jag ska ha med mig kan vara några saker som vi har som krav för att kunna utföra vårt arbete.\n\nJag gillar definitionen “vad jag behöver för att kunna utföra mitt arbete” som krav på föregående steg. Det är inte elakt att ställa krav på varandra. Tvärtom. De flesta uppskattar det och vi skapar också förståelse.\n\nMen som i exemplet ovan så slutar det inte här. Fler har behov av information i offerten, de som ska fakturera. Vilken är faktureringsadressen och organisationsnumret.\n\nSom ni märker är det detaljer som krävs för att på riktigt förstå. Lämnar vi detaljerna så blir det fort abstrakt och svårt för verksamheten att hänga med i resonemanget.\n\nSteg för steg lägger du ett pussel och ritar en karta där mycket beroenden finns och ungefär där brukar insikten komma att vi jobbar egentligen inte alls i silos. I verkligheten är vi ett nätverk. Vi har dock valt att organisera oss i silos.\n\n## Silos eller hängrännor?\n\nDet är dock lite humor i mångas försök att försöka komma åt silosproblemet genom att skapa nya silos. De kanske använder begrepp som “vi ska organiseras oss med värdeströmmar istället”. Det enda du lyckas med är då att skapa samma problem. Om silos är det negativa uttrycket så är hängrännor samma sak för att organisera med flöden.\n\nOundvikligen har du två perspektiv som behöver samordning eller synkning.\n\n→ Du har ett flöde - tänk produkt.\n\n→ Du har en funktion - tänk vad som internt behöver göras.\n\nI boken Team Topology av Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais beskriver de tre sätt huvudsakliga sätt att se samarbeten på.\n\n- **Samarbete:** arbeta tillsammans under en bestämd tid för att upptäcka nya saker (API:er, arbetssätt, tekniker etc.)\n- **X-som-tjänst:** ett team tillhandahåller och ett annat team använder något ”som en tjänst”\n- **Facilitering:** ett team stöttar och vägleder ett annat team\n\n![CleanShot 2025-05-15 at 08.15.59 2@2x.png](Alla%20s%C3%A4ger%20samarbete%20Men%20vi%20organiserar%20oss%20som%20om/CleanShot_2025-05-15_at_08.15.59_22x.png)\n\nBåda perspektiven behövs. Ibland går jag så långt att prata om vad som optimeras.\n\n- Processer: Beskriver flödesoptimeringar - hur vi gör.\n- Funktioner: Beskriver resursoptimering - vad vi gör.\n\nOch om du är lite observant så ser du att det saknas minst ett perspektiv 🙂\n\n- Produkt: Beskriver intäktsoptimering - varför vi gör saker för vem.\n\nMed dessa som bas och du hittar vilka relationer som finns mellan teamen, se ovan, så börjar du skapa en karta över ett system, en organism som har ordentligt med beroenden.\n\nFör att bryta silos så behövs den kartan så att vi kan tillsammans säga “ja det där är vår verksamhet”. Vi kan också vara överens om “vad jag behöver” för att kunna utföra mitt arbete, det vill säga mitt krav på föregående del i kedjan samt vara medveten om vad nästa behöver.\n\nNär jag är i service för någon annan, då finns ett leveransansvar till andra för att de ska kunna göra sitt jobb. Precis som våra relation till kunderna.\n\nDr. Russell Ackoff en av grundarna till systemtänkande i världen.\n\n[https://youtu.be/FhcfjE7tJDY?si=LKT94OwZ8-_UH4DW](https://youtu.be/FhcfjE7tJDY?si=LKT94OwZ8-_UH4DW)\n\nHan beskriver att man löser problem genom att jobba en av fyra principer, och han menar att den fjärde är viktigt att fundera över.\n\n1. **Absolution**: Att ignorera eller anta att problemet löser sig självt.\n2. **Resolve**: Att åtgärda problemets grundorsak och tillämpa samma procedur.\n3. **Solve**: Att hitta en verklig lösning som kräver forskning och undersökning.\n4. **Dissolve**: Att omdesigna systemet eller dess miljö för att hantera problemet.\n\n## **Så hur gör man?**\n\nGör x och y så uppnår du z.\n\nTyvärr. Nej. Så enkelt är det inte. Jag skulle fundera på om vi har bra beskrivningar på följande tre saker.\n\n- Produkt: Beskriver intäktsoptimering - varför vi gör saker för vem.\n- Processer: Beskriver flödesoptimeringar - hur vi gör.\n- Funktioner: Beskriver resursoptimering - vad vi gör.\n\nNästa steg är att fundera hur dessa relaterar till varandra?\n\nDå börjar en karta ta form. \n\nMed olika intressenter börja då diskutera den kartan i olika perspektiv.\n\n- Skav och problem\n- Vår plannering\n- Resurstillsättning och kompetens\n- Våra arbetssätt\n\nBörja smått. Utveckla stegvis. Acceptera att den är scrappy i början.\n\nSkapa dig en en karta, bild som kan så småningom vara startpunkten för de flesta diskussioner. Då skapar du gemensam förståelse på riktigt.\n\nOch en startpunkt att tänka systematiskt har börjat.\n\nStort lycka till!\n\n---\n\nDet här är vad jag jobbar med på dagarna som konsult.\n\nJag vill visa att det finns **användbara mönster.** Inte stora förändringsprogram som dör efter två år. Utan små, begripliga sätt att bygga systematiskt bättre verksamhet, varje dag.\n\nMönster för:\n\n- Att brygga över silos.\n- Att skapa struktur utan att paralysera.\n- Att våga ställa krav utan att det uppfattas som jobbig.\n- Att göra t.ex. information till en tillgång, inte ett problem.\n\nOm du är intresserad av verksamhetsarkitekturen i sig så kan du kika på en [mall](https://miro.com/miroverse/business-map-template/) i Miro vi, Cecilia Nordén å jag, gjort.

Förvrängd röst. “ITSÄK” visas i undertext.**\n\n**INT:**\n\nBerätta – hur hamnade du här?\n\n**ITSÄK:**\n\nJag var IT-säkerhetschef på ett stort svenskt bolag.\n\nMitt uppdrag var att hålla oss borta från tidningsrubriker och viten från IMY, **Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten**.\n\n“No expense reserved”, sa de. Men det var bara snack.\n\n**INT:**\n\nSå… det gick inte riktigt så?\n\n**ITSÄK:**\n\nNej. Jag fick aldrig egen budget.\n\nDen låg under finanschefen – en man som inte kunde skilja en skrivare från en server.\n\nVi hamnade i pressen. Surprise.\n\nMinns VD:n som skällde ut mig efter noter.\n\nJag frågade:\n\n**“Kan jag få budget till det jag flaggat för i ett år?”**\n\nHan svarade surt:\n\n**“För vad då? IT-säkerhet. Vad är det ens?”**\n\n**“Spelar ingen roll, det finns inga pengar.”**\n\nJag försökte säga att IT säkerhet handlar om mer än att inte hamna i tidiningarna. Men då hade han redan mentalt lämnat mötet.\n\n---\n\n### **Scen 2 – Presskonferens. VD vid podiet.**\n\n**VD:**\n\n“Vi har gjort ett historiskt resultat.\n\nMaximal avkastning.”\n\n(*Applåder. Lätt skratt.*)\n\nITSÄK: Och så var aktieägarna kortsiktigt nöjda.\n\n---\n\n### **Scen 3 – Tillbaka i intervjurummet.**\n\n**INT:**\n\nVar det då du valde att sluta?\n\n**ITSÄK:**\n\nJa, tydligen fanns det pengar till dom själva, men inte till att skydda bolaget.\n\n**INT:**\n\nOkej, vad är dina tips för att inte hamna här?\n\nIT-SÄK\n\nVad skulle farfar gjort?\n\nFarfar?\n\nJa du vet. Farfarsprincipen. Fyra ögon. Att du själv kan inte skicka in en faktura till bolaget och godkänna den.\n\nDen principen borde gälla beslut kring IT säkerhet också. Separera ansvaret. \n\nNär det saknas rollseparering hamnar vi i läget: Då vaktar räven hönshuset. \n\nHumoriserad manusversion – punchigare och roligare\n\n**Format:** Intervju + satiriska cutaways, on‑screen-text och ljudeffekter\n\n**Ton:** Torr humor, underdriven leverans, visuella blinkningar\n\n---\n\n### Kall öppning – “Räven” gör entré\n\n> Ljud: Spänningsmusik som plötsligt klipps av av ett hönskackel\n> \n\nBild på rubrik: \"Räven vaktar hönshuset\" med en tecknad räv i slips. En skylt poppar upp: \"Det här är inte en dokumentär om rävar. Tyvärr.\"\n\nKlipp till siluettintervjun.\n\n**INT:** Berätta – hur hamnade du här?\n\n**ITSÄK:** Jag följde doften av underfinansierad säkerhet. Och gratis bullar på fredagar.\n\nOn‑screen text: \"Gratis bullar ≠ gratis säkerhet\"\n\n---\n\n### Scen 1 – Budgetgymnastik\n\n> Ljud: Kassalåda “ka‑ching”, direkt följt av Windows‑felpling\n> \n\n**ITSÄK:** \"No expense reserved\" sa de. Det är som \"all you can eat\" fast du får bara titta på menyn.\n\nCutaway: CFO pekar på en skrivare och säger \"stabil server\". Skrivaren börjar skriva ut aktieutdelningar.\n\nOn‑screen text: \"Rollseparering, någon?\"\n\n**INT:** Så… det gick inte riktigt så?\n\n**ITSÄK:** Jag fick aldrig egen budget. Jag hade en post‑it. Den var gul. Det var min roadmap.\n\n---\n\n### Scen 2 – Presskonferensen\n\n> Ljud: Högtidlig fanfar som övergår i modemljud från 90‑talet\n> \n\n**VD:** \"Vi har gjort ett historiskt resultat. Maximal avkastning!\"\n\nKlipp till hönshus. En räv i kostym delar ut dividend‑majs till hönsen. Hönsen applåderar. En höna frågar: \"Vad är en patch?\"\n\nOn‑screen text: \"Patch Tuesday ≠ Taco Tuesday\"\n\n---\n\n### Scen 3 – Brorsonens bootcamp\n\n> Ljud: Ukulele‑jingle, överlagd Comic Sans‑grafik \"CYBERSÄK 101\"\n> \n\n**ITSÄK:** Brorsan till VD:n kom med sitt \"utbildningspaket\". Random quiz från nätet. Fråga 1: \"Vad är ett lösenord?\" Svarsalternativ: A) \"1234\" B) \"12345\" C) \"Password\" D) \"Alla ovan\"\n\nFakturan? Samma som min årsbudget. Med emoji i referensraden.\n\nOn‑screen text: \"Äkta story. Tyvärr.\"\n\n---\n\n### Scen 4 – När det small\n\n> Ljud: Klassisk film‑\"inception‑BWAAAM\" och ett hönskackel i slow motion\n> \n\nCutaway: Servern står öppen mot internet. En dörrmatta med texten \"Welcome, threat actors\". Kamera zoomar in på en uppdateringsruta: \"Uppdatera? – Senare\". Undertext: \"Senare sedan 2017\"\n\n**ITSÄK:** Ingen patch. Ingen brandvägg. Första ransomware‑attacken.\n\n**INT:** Första?\n\n**ITSÄK:** Ja. Vi gick från \"Defense in depth\" till \"Offense in debt\".\n\n---\n\n### Scen 5 – Lärdomar utan pekpinnar\n\n> Ljud: Klick från en säkerhetsbrytare, mjuk musik\n> \n\nGrafik: \"Tre saker innan du tar ansvar för IS/IT‑säkerhet\"\n\n1. Rollseparering på riktigt. Den som maxar utdelning ska inte granska sig själv. Det är som att låta räven utforma hönsens nattvaktsschema.\n2. Egen budget med mandat. Post‑it är inte ett styrmedel.\n3. Baslinor först: patchning, brandväggar, backup som faktiskt återläses. Taco Tuesday är valfri. Patch Tuesday är inte det.\n\nOn‑screen text i hörnet: \"Backup utan restore = skärmsläckare för samvetet\"\n\n---\n\n### Avrundning – punchline och call‑to‑action\n\n**INT:** Om du fick säga en sak till din gamla ledning?\n\n**ITSÄK:** \"Säkerhet är en kostnad… tills det blir en siffra i pressmeddelandet. Då är det en investering du önskar att du redan gjort.\"\n\nRäven i slips tittar in i kameran. Paus. Tar av sig rävhuvudet. Det är CFO.\n\nOn‑screen text: \"Räven var vi hela tiden. Plottwist.\"\n\n> Slutbild: Lista med \"Gör imorgon\" blinkar in: 1) Separera roller 2) Ring säkerhetschefen 3) Patcha. Sen credits med hönskackel‑remix\n>",

Runt denna byggs ett litet antal input‑metrikar som teamen direkt kan påverka, så att dagliga beslut och experiment kan kopplas till ett tydligt, långsiktigt mål. Playbooken visar hur man formulerar ett tydligt North Star‑statement, validerar det mot en checklista, och gör det operativt genom ägarskap, mätning och lärloopar.\n\nBoken adresserar även vanliga fällor som fåfänga metrikar, för många inputs och mål som ligger för långt från kundvärde. Den betonar att ramverket måste in i ritualer, dashboardar och portföljbeslut för att skapa verklig effekt, samt hur och när man bör byta North Star när produktstrategi eller affärsmodell förändras.\n\n### Metoder i playbooken (5–10)\n\n- North Star‑statement‑övningen för att koppla målgrupp, värde och mätning\n- North Star‑checklistan för att validera kundvärde, tillväxtkoppling och styrbarhet\n- Input‑metrik‑kartläggning och ägarskap per input\n- Metric tree/driver tree för att visualisera input → NSM‑samband\n- Experiment‑ och lärloopar kopplade till inputs och hypoteser\n- Dashboarding och ritualer (planering, veckorevyer) för att göra NSM operativ\n- Troubleshooting‑mönster för att undvika vanliga fällor och anti‑mönster\n- Byte av North Star: kriterier och process när strategin skiftar\n- Portföljstyrning med evidens: justera satsningar utifrån input → NSM‑effekt",

Well, Albert Einstein said that perfectly.\n\n> Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler\n> \n\n![[Presentations.png]]\n\nTo create a shared understanding of an organisation, we often try to invoke new words that might help. Often, that fails. Simon Senik wrote a book that changed a lot in the business Area. *Start with why.* He called it the golden circle in order: Why, What, How. Without more details, that was too simple.\n\nIn many attempts by the Enterprise Community, there have been a lot of attempts to create frameworks. Some work better than others. Everyone eventually fails.\n\nWhat if that is ok? To fail?\n\nWhat if we create a language that is 80% correct, doesn’t fit everything, and doesn’t take care of all corner edge(s)? What if we use words that are already in use and try to humanise communication?\n\nWe will be using an easy-to-understand Business Map as the Anchor Model.\n\nThat is our mission.\n\nIt starts with four words. Why, What, How and Who.\n\nIt might be to oversimplify, but we will try anyway :-)\n\nRemember that what you understand, what you communicate and what the receiver eventually understands is something else.\n\n## Next steps\n\n1. We will start 2024 by creating the easiest-to-use Miro Template for full collaboration.\n2. Half day of Workshop with this Template, Map-Day.\n3. We are starting a Community in February that we want you to be a part of.\n4. Evolve to our mission to create an easy-to-understand communication.\n\nCecilia and Thomas have experience from over 100+ organisations that we have helped in courses and consultants. One of the main problems comes down to the misinterpretation of the communication of words.\n\nDo you want to be a part of the solution for better communication?

Yes, there are more than one way to view the Strategy. THE WORKFLOW VIEW Some of you may have watched the evolution of the Strategy Clockwork, which is a typical decision workflow view of the Strategy. It illustrates the main processes of the Strategy Cycle (Formulation & Execution), as well as the decision stages that we go through along these processes. Strategy Model's components (as well as Strategic Plan's components) are generated in some of these stages. But we also have procedural-only stage, like the Strategy Feasibility Gateway, or the Strategy Review, which don't produce any model components. THE STRUCTURAL VIEW You might have seen a series of posts (links below) that illustrate the Strategy Model components, aggregated into constructs (Strategy Core, Business Model, Strategy Execution System) that exhibit the interdependencies between Strategy's components, as well as between the constructs themselves. Those illustrations are presenting a structural view of the Strategy. Sometimes the difference between different views may get a little blurry. For instance, Strategy Execution is a process for implementing the Strategy and for adapting it along its implementation. But we also have a Strategy Execution System that is a structural construct that incorporates a number of components that allow us to decide on Corrective & Adaptation actions, along a Strategy Execution cycle (Strategy is a multi-annual construct that gets implemented in a sequence of annual Execution Cycles). If you want to get more clarity on these Strategy views, don't forget that there is a coming edition of the [Explaining Strategy course](https://www.linkedin.com/company/explaining-strategy?trk=public_post-text), scheduled for Sep 1-29.

Without a plan to address them, you’re just paying interest. Here’s why quantifying and managing all forms of debt is crucial to your organisation’s survival.\nIs debt always a bad thing? No. Sometimes, you need capital from outside to realise your idea or invest to move faster. The problem is when your cash flow is used only to pay the interest.\nDept can have many shapes and forms. It can be:\n- a financial debt\n- technical debt\n- organisational debt\n- skill debt\n- innovation debt\nSometimes, you need to go faster than your organisation can, creating a debt that can be dealt with later. But after a while, you only pay interest if you don’t tackle the problem.\nI strongly recommend quantifying your debt, putting a number on it, and, most importantly, creating a comprehensive plan to work with it. Having a plan that is communicated is the key.\nFor e.g.\n- Financial dept: 100mUSD - 8mUSD in interest\n- Technical dept: 250mUSD - 25mUSD in “interest”\n- Skill Dept: 100mUSD - 30mUSD in “interest”.\nThe numbers are, of course, more objective than a bank loan can be.\nFor example, after many years, the Technical Debt would cost 250mUSD to fix in its entirety. In the current state, we need to add 25mUSD per year to patch what is broken for today’s situation. Remember, a system was often built for its purpose those years ago, so that decision might have been the right one at the time. However, the lack of investment has contributed to the current situation over the years.\nYou could have a prognosis that if you invest 100mUSD, you go from 25mUSD to 5mUSD and have an ROI of 5 years.\nThe same goes for the Skill Debt, where you might need more or other competence today. That can be much more costly to handle in everyday operations. Again, put a number on it. Make a plan. Be transparent.\nSome say it is impossible to argue. But last year’s profits were okay, right? Another way is to borrow money and not put that in the books and say, “Hey, look, we’re rich.”\nSuppose you are transparent with all your debts. In that case, there will be a better discussion of whether we should:\ndo the next shiny thing\nor fix our basics and get a sustainable organisation that doesn’t only pay interest.\nA bank loan is only one type of debt.",

    "body": "# Förutsättningarna i strategiarbetet\n\nStrategi är inte något man visar upp.\nDet är ett samtal som måste fortsätta.\nSå fort man säger att man är klar, slutar man tänka.\n\n# Förutsättningarna i strategiarbetet\n\n*Av Thomas Larsson*\n\nVad behövs egentligen för ett lyckat strategiarbete?\n\nDet finns inget enkelt svar. Men jag vet hur man inte ska göra.\n\nJag tänker inte utge mig för att vara en strategi-guru som kan analysera omvärld, marknad och den egna organisationen och sedan sätta några bets som visar sig vara rätt.\n\nMen jag kan påstå att många bygger sitt strategiarbete bakvänt. Man tittar för mycket utåt och för lite inåt. Som arkitekt har jag såklart en bias. Jag behöver en struktur för att förstå verksamheten. Det går att jobba utan, men det blir onödigt mycket dimma.\n\n## **Det börjar med en hypotes**\n\nAlla strategier handlar i grunden om en förflyttning.\n\nVi ska någonstans. Bli bäst, billigast, störst, mest unika eller mest relevanta. Men oavsett mål är det i början bara ett antagande. En strategihypotes.\n\nHur man kommer fram till den hypotesen kan variera. Kaplan och Norton pratar om Balanced Scorecard. McKinsey om 7S. XXP (Extreme Enterprise Planning) är ett annat exempel.\n\nMen oavsett modell måste hypotesen testas.\n\n## **Det du behöver för att testa strategin**\n\nFör att kunna validera strategihypotesen behövs en bild av hur verksamheten faktiskt fungerar. Några verktyg jag ofta använder:\n\n1. **Affärsmodell** (till exempel BMC) om affären i sig ska förändras.\n    \n    Hjälper till att se *hur värde skapas och fångas* och om intäktslogiken håller när strategin förändras.\n    \n2. **Kundresa** om kundens beteende ändras.\n    \n    Används för att förstå *var upplevelsen skaver* och var nya möjligheter till värde uppstår när strategin möter marknaden.\n    \n3. **Process- och förmågekarta** för att förstå förflyttningar i verksamheten.\n    \n    Visar *vilka förmågor som bär strategin* och vilka som behöver stärkas, byggas upp eller kanske avvecklas.\n    \n4. **Informationsmodell och systemkarta** för att se hur informationsflöden påverkas.\n    \n    Hjälper till att förstå *vilken information som blir kritisk* för att kunna genomföra strategin, och var flaskhalsarna finns.\n    \n\nTillsammans bildar de en meta-modell över vad strategin egentligen ska påverka.\n\nStrategin blir då inte ett dokument utan en uppsättning prioriterade aktiviteter. Vad vi ska göra och lika viktigt, vad vi inte ska göra.\n\n## **En svår sak**\n\nRichard Rumelt beskriver i sin bok *The Crux* att en bra strategi ofta handlar om att identifiera en eller två riktigt svåra saker och lösa just dem.\n\nDet är sällan en lista med fyrtio initiativ.\n\nDet är oftare en riktning som kräver mod och fokus på det som gör skillnad.\n\n## **Reality check, inte ritual**\n\nStrategiarbete får aldrig bli en linjär process. Det ska vara iterativt.\n\nVarje hypotes behöver testas, stressas och ibland kasseras. “Now it’s only execution” är ofta ett tecken på att tänkandet tog slut för tidigt.\n\nJag brukar titta på alternativa scenarier.\n\n- Kanske outsourca problemet.\n- Eller bygga kompetensen själv.\n- Eller välja en helt annan väg.\n\nDet gör strategin mer trovärdig att inte låsa fast sig i en enda möjlig väg framåt.\n\n## **Förmågor som karta**\n\nEn förmågekarta hjälper till att se var hypotesen träffar.\n\n- Vilka delar av verksamheten kommer klara förändringen bra?\n- Vilka kommer få problem?\n- Vad förstår vi inte än?\n\nFörmågekartan blir då ett verktyg för att visualisera förflyttningen, nu- och senläge. Det kan vara förändringar i People, Processes och Tools. Eller helt nya förmågor som måste till.\n\n## **Slutord**\n\nStrategi är inte en PowerPoint.\n\nDet är ett pågående samtal om vad vi ska bli bra på och vad vi väljer bort.\n\nUtan det samtalet finns ingen riktning, bara aktivitet.\n\n[What_is_strategy_4_pdf_1690720173.pdf](F%C3%B6ruts%C3%A4ttningarna%20i%20strategiarbetet/What_is_strategy_4_pdf_1690720173.pdf)\n\nVad behövs i grunden för ett lyckat strategiarbete? Det finns inte ett enkelt svar på den frågan. Dock vet jag hur man inte ska göra.\n\nTänker inte påstå att jag är en strategi-expert som kan jobba igenom omvärld, marknad och den egna organisation och sätta ett antal bets som sedan visa sig vara rätt.\n\nDet jag dock tänker påstå är att många bygger sitt strategiarbete genom att titta för mycket utåt och för lite vad verksamheten kan bli bra på. Som arkitekt har jag såklart en bias på hur jag vill beskriva en verksamhet. Det är viss struktur jag behöver för att kunna förstå bättre. Det går utan, men är enklar med. \n\nSå vad behöver man för att jobba med strategi i en organisation? Vissa säger, inget. Men då kommer vi tillbaka till mitt påstående att vi inte har fokus på vad vi kan bli riktigt bra på.\n\nMitt resonemang går ungefär såhär:\n\nDet börjar med ett framtida läge. Vi ska åt något håll. Vara bäst, billigast, flest produkter, flest länder, störst volym, högst kvalitet, rätt målgrupp, unikt erbjudande, smartast genomförandet, bäst supplychain, bästa partners. Oavsett vilket mål och vilken strategi man kommit fram till så är det ett antagande som borde verifieras i omgångar. Vi kan kallad det för en strategihypotes. Hur man kommer fram till målen och strategivalen är det andra än jag som bättre kan förklara. Balanced Scorecard (Kaplan & Norton), XXP – Extreme Enterprise Planning, McKinsey 7S är exempel.\n\nMen för att validera sin hypotes anser jag att det behövs ett antal saker (inte alla, men några).\n\n1. Affärsmodell (t.ex. BMC) om man ska förändra sin affär.\n2. Kundresa om kundens beteende ändras.\n3. Process och förmågekarta för att förstå förändringar i verksamheten.\n4. Informationsmodell och systemkarta för att förstå informationsförsörjningen.\n\n![CleanShot 2025-05-13 at 22.25.55@2x.png](F%C3%B6ruts%C3%A4ttningarna%20i%20strategiarbetet/CleanShot_2025-05-13_at_22.25.552x.png)\n\nOm ovanstånde är meta-modellen för vad strategin ska åstadkomma. Strategin ska slutligen bestå av prioriterade aktiviteter som behövs för att nå målet. Vad vi gör. Och kanske än viktigare, vad vi inte gör.\n\nOm man inte vill gå djupare så beskriver Richard Rumelt i sin bok “The Crux” [https://thecruxbook.com/](https://thecruxbook.com/) att vägen till förflyttningen som behöver göras består ofta av en eller två svåra saker. Identifiera och värdera dessa.\n\nI ett iterativt arbete så kan då hypotesen snabbt besvaras om det går, genom att en “realitycheck” eller provtryckning görs för varje hypotes som kommer upp på bordet. Det man ska undvika är att se det som en linjär process där man säger “nu är strategiarbetet klart, dags för verksamheten för execution”.\n\n> Now its only execution foks.\n> \n\nEn sak jag brukar jobba med är att se om det finns scenarion för att lösa utmaningen. Kanske outsourca problemet, eller skaffa sig rätt kompetens själv, eller ta en annan väg. Det gör strategin mer trovärdig, enligt mig.\n\nEtt sätt att använda förmågekartor är att göra lager ovanpå förmågan för att se var det strategiska hypotesen slår. Vad som kommer troligen fungera bra. Vad som inte kommer fungera. Vad vi inte förstår.\n\nFörmågorna kan agera som bilden över vilka förflyttningar som behöver göras. Många använder People, Processes and Tools som perspektiv vad som ska förändras. Nu och senläge. Det kan även vara helt nya förmågor som behövs.\n\n![CleanShot 2025-05-13 at 22.48.12@2x.png](F%C3%B6ruts%C3%A4ttningarna%20i%20strategiarbetet/CleanShot_2025-05-13_at_22.48.122x.png)\n\n![CleanShot 2025-05-13 at 22.48.54@2x.png](F%C3%B6ruts%C3%A4ttningarna%20i%20strategiarbetet/CleanShot_2025-05-13_at_22.48.542x.png)\n\nObs!\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341098103548137472?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7341098103548137472%2C7343514865640030208%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287343514865640030208%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7341098103548137472%29\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7350131433547464704?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7350131433547464704%2C7350144149544689664%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287350144149544689664%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7350131433547464704%29\n\n[Business_Architecture_as_Strategy_1747939264.pdf](F%C3%B6ruts%C3%A4ttningarna%20i%20strategiarbetet/Business_Architecture_as_Strategy_1747939264.pdf)\n\nSee ChatGPT (Strategy).",

Why? Because the layer you choose dictates how users will view and understand your data—and ultimately defines their experience.\n\nConsider Google Maps. Its main focus is transportation, and it is designed to help people get from point A to point B, whether by car, bus, bike, or foot. It’s about highlighting only what is important to send the message to your audience as simple as possible.\n\nSo, when designing a map or model, ask yourself:\n\n1. Who is the primary audience for this map or model?\n2. What’s the important information my map should show?\n3. How can I make it as straightforward as possible without distraction?\n4. What specific action do I want the user to take after viewing your map?\n\nCreating a map isn’t about piling on data; it’s about understanding what’s essential to your audience and stripping away what’s not. Less is more!\n\nRemember: No one needs a map that is a piece of art. 😉\n\nBefore you dive in, always answer the key question: “What’s the most important message I want my audience to see?” And once you’re done, be sure to follow up to see if that message is received by your audience.\n\n## Reference\n\n[https://dataanddesign.substack.com/p/saying-more-with-less-how-designing](https://dataanddesign.substack.com/p/saying-more-with-less-how-designing)\nAuthor: Christopher K Wong\nhttps://www.perplexity.ai/search/choosing-a-map-overlay-is-the-vfM838HIRGKj.Da6QbhsTw",

Men det hindrar inte mig att be dig försöka 😊\n\nJag har senaste åren funderat 🤔 över vad som gör organisationer långsiktigt relevanta!\n\nDet handlar även fortsättningsvis att förstå kundens **riktiga problem**.\n\nDu behöver troligen tänka om lite när det kommer till långsiktig planering. Idag kanske du funderar i banor som, digitialisering, innovation och trendande ord. Jag vill att du istället…\n\n…tittar bakåt!\n\n## Dåläge 👀\n\nVad blev du och din organisation tvungna att göra de senaste fem åren? Vilka måsten har genomförts? Vilka var besluten?\n\nVar det en ny eller uppdaterad produkt eller tjänst som upptog din uppmärksamhet? Var det lagkrav (som GDPR)? Var det en ihopslagning för att nå nya marknadsandelar? Här hittar du förhoppningsvis de beslut som ledde fram till nödvändiga förändringar, även vilka prioriteringar som gjordes. Några av besluten kan ha lett till dagens interna problem.\n\n## Nuläge 🚦\n\nSen försöker du kartlägga nuläget. Vilka förutsättningar har du idag, givet er historia? Vart är du och organisationen på väg om det fortsätter som det gör idag? Summera då både styrkor, svagheter, hot och möjligheter. Interna som externa.\n\n## Senläge 🗺️\n\nNär dessa grundläggande delar finns på plats, då kan du börja sia om framtiden. Använd dig då av frågorna:\n\n1. Vad **måste** vi göra för vår överlevnad? Vilka **beslut** behöver vi ta?\n2. Vilka olika **scenarion** har vi?\n\nOm ledningen inte behöver svara på den frågan om det är ett **måste** så behöver du kanske byta ut ledningen. Ingen organisation överlever utan att adressera sina måsten och det enda som är konstant här i världen är…\n\n…förändring.\n\nHur du väljer att se på er förändring är upp till dig. Med ett proaktivt arbetssätt så kan du skapa den framtid du vill ha på dina villkor istället för att reaktivt reagera på vad andra gör.\n\n**Scenarion** är till för att hjälpa till att fånga flera möjliga framtider. Det här är egentligen nyckeln att vara mer förberedd. Istället för att ha en enda plan, så har du fler.\n\nDå, nu, sen. Gör om.\n\nHistorien upprepar sig själv.

Ofta går det bra.\n\nMen…\n\nJag har också skrivit bredare, djupare än vad min specifika roll idag är.\n\nEtt försök till summering av vad jag skrivit som svarar på frågan “hur tänker du?”, kanske min “Best-of-writing-list 2025” :-)\n\nDu hittar mitt nyhetsbrev på Substack [https://thomaslarsson.substack.com/](https://thomaslarsson.substack.com/)\n\n## Först lite kort bakgrund\n\nJag har egentligen två huvudsakliga bakgrunder. De första är att jag i grunden är grafisk formgivare och kommunikatör. Delar som format :-) mig mycket. Den andra är som projektledare inom IT i herrans massa år.\n\nVid den obligatoriska 40-årskrisen så ställde jag mig frågan - vad ska jag bli när jag blir stor? En klok person så då till mig, - om du slår ihop vad du kan vad blir det då?\n\nDär börjar det jag gör nu. Affären, arkitektur och helheter. Så vad jag skriver om är då en bredd som skapar en struktur med en helhet.\n\n## Det skrivna ordet\n\n### Böcker\n\nVarför får man för sig att skriva en bok? Det enkla svaret, jag vet inte. Men det är nyttigt att få ned sina tankar i bokform har jag upptäckt. Ett ytterligare sätt är att använda sig av en redaktör som ger dig ytterligare ge feedback vad som fungerar, inte fungerar och vad du behöver kanske utvecka. Det valde jag att göra för mina båda böcker.\n\n**“Lat men effektiv”**. 2017 skrev jag en bok som handlade en del om Lean, arbetssätt och hur man kunde praktiskt anamma det i arbetslivet.

Att lösa ett **riktigt problem** för en kund. Men den här gången är det nya problem, utmaningar och förutsättningar. Det är så, anser jag, hur organisationer håller sig ständigt relevanta.\n\n[https://amzn.eu/d/iGzlv0Z](https://amzn.eu/d/iGzlv0Z)\n\n**“Relevant”**. 2024 utkom även på engelska. [https://a.co/d/cqf7h0D](https://a.co/d/cqf7h0D)\n\n## Artiklar\n\nUnder åren har det blivit många artiklar. Jagat likes på sociala plattformar som vilken annan Wanna-be-influenser.

När, om någonsin, är det läge att införa det begreppet hos Vattenfall tror du? Och vad är din syn rent allmänt?

Det kanske till och med är ett riktigt problem\n\n- Påverkar det affären negativt?\n- Stör det kunden, eller dig, på riktigt?\n- Sätter det käppar i hjulet för det dagliga arbetet?\n- Skulle en lösning göra dina kunder märkbart nöjdare?\n\nRiktiga problem känns, i magen, i vardagen, i relationen med kunden.\n\nVilka frågor ställer du för att skilja riktiga problem från hitte-på-problem?",

Maps are not just about finding our way; they are powerful tools that guide our understanding of the world and if you want your business.\n**Understanding Maps**\n- When we think about maps, we often picture a static image showing roads, rivers, and cities. But maps are so much more. They are stable companions in an ever-changing world, providing a sense of direction whether you’re exploring a bustling city or navigating through life’s metaphorical wilderness.\n**The Power of Zoom In**\n- Let’s zoom in, literally. With modern maps, we can dive into incredible detail. Zoom in level by level, and you see streets, then buildings, and even individual trees. This zoom feature isn’t just about seeing closer; it’s about understanding our environment on a micro-level.\n**Maps as Guides**\n- Maps guide us. Not just in the literal sense of getting from point A to B, but they guide our understanding. They tell stories of landscapes, cultures, history, and even politics. They make the complex world more comprehensible.\n\n**Mapping Beyond Geography**\n\n- Maps aren’t just geographical. They map economies, social trends, and even our brains. Imagine a map of human thought, or a map showing the spread of a viral tweet. Maps are tools for understanding patterns, trends, and connections.\n\n**Stability in a Changing World**\n\n- In our fast-paced, ever-changing world, maps provide a sense of stability. They are constant yet adaptable. As our world evolves, so do maps. They are living documents constantly updated to reflect new roads, new countries, and even new planets.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- In conclusion, maps are more than just tools for direction. They are guides to understanding our complex world. They provide stability in a fast-changing environment and connect us in ways we often overlook. And they are excellent for understanding an organisation.\n\n---\n\n# References\n\n1. [[Map a help not replacement]]",

Nya chefer som kommer in ritar gärna om organisationsschemat, nya ramverk fylls på med bokstavskombinationer som får Star Wars-modeller att framstå som tydliga. Ändå väljer många att styra och mäta just där. Resultatet är tyvärr givet.\n\nNi blir oflexibla och konkurrenterna får fördelen.\n\n**Förmågor är något helt annat**\n\nEn förmåga är VAD organisationen faktiskt kan åstadkomma, oavsett process och form. Att utveckla nya erbjudanden, att rekrytera kompetens, att hantera leverantörer. Det är förmågor. De består även när ni ritar om kartan. Hamel & Prahalad uttryckte det redan för 20 år sedan:\n\n> “What people respect about the companies … is not how they are structured … but their capabilities.”\n> \n\n*Capitalizing on Capabilities*\n\nPwC Strategy visar samma sak. Strategier faller när de inte byggs på verkliga förmågor, utan fastnar i strukturer och processlogik (min argumentation att det är dåliga saker att leda och styra mot).\n\n**Tre enkla skäl att byta fokus:**\n\n- **Förmågor är stabila.** De står kvar även när organisationen ändras.\n- **Förmågor är begripliga.** Alla förstår vad det innebär att “kunna utveckla erbjudanden”.\n- **Förmågor är styrbara.** Ni kan följa upp på förmågor utan att kväva arbetssätten.\n\nPulakos & Kaiser (HBR, 2020) påminner:\n\n> “To achieve genuine agility and resilience, companies first have to commit themselves to stability.”\n> \n\nDet är exakt det processer och avdelningar inte ger. De är till för att förändras – inte för att vara styrande fundament. När ni placerar styrningen där bygger ni cement i stället för rörelse.\n\n**Processer** finns för att beskriva hur arbetet går till just nu och för att kunna förbättras eller bytas ut när vardagen förändras. De måste vara flexibla. Där har du verksamhetens möjlighet att kunna ställa om och möte omvärldens behov.\n\n**Organisationen** finns för att fördela ansvar och resurser. Den ritas om när förutsättningar skiftar. Ofta är den även kopplad till kostnad och [,](http://bokföring.men) bokföring. Men även här utmanar jag och förordar förmågor istället. \n\nMin poäng är!

Simplicity makes ideas memorable, easily understood, and actionable.\n2. Memorable Ideas:\nSimple ideas stick. They are easy to remember and share.\n3. Clarity:\nPeople understand simple messages fast. No need for long explanations.\n4. Actionable:\nWhen things are simple, there is less room for confusion. People know what to do next.\n5. Less is More:\nFocus on the core message. Remove unnecessary details.\n6. Avoid Jargon:\nUse plain language. Everyone should understand your message.\n7. Visuals Help:\nUse simple visuals to explain complex ideas. A picture can be worth a thousand words.\n8. Consistent Messaging:\nKeep your message consistent across all platforms. This reinforces understanding.\n9. Test and Refine:\nShare your message with others. See if they understand it quickly. Refine as needed.\n10. Practice Simplicity:\nMake simplicity a habit. Apply it to all areas of your business communication.\n\nRemember, simplicity leads to quicker understanding and quicker results!\n\nSteve Jobs once said, “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” He was onto something – think about it!\nHere’s why simplicity works:\n- It’s memorable. Simple ideas stick.\n- It’s easily understood. People get it, fast.\n- It’s actionable. Less room for confusion or misinterpretation.\nSo, how can you simplify your business explanation? Try focusing on only four words: Why, Who, What, and How.\nHere’s how you can apply this:\nWHY: Define your purpose.\n↳ What problem do you solve for who? Your product or services.\nWHO: Find Out Who Matters.\n↳ Who is buying your stuff, and who fits in your team?\nWHAT: The things you do (a verb)\n↳ What do you need to do to solve your customer’s problems?\nHOW: Explain How You Work.\n↳ What steps do you need to take to fix your customer’s problems?\n\nAre you using overcomplicated words when they are not needed? Could these four be a good start?",

Budget, beslut och belöningar ligger på samma ställe, vilket gör säkerhetsarbetet till en eftertanke snarare än en integrerad del av styrningen.\n\nOm du är CFO och ansvarar för maximal aktieutdelning, så är varje investering, även i IT-säkerhet, ett hot mot det kortsiktiga resultatet och kravet på utdelning mot aktieägarna. Då är det frestande att vänta in nästa revision hellre än att förebygga. Men det finns regler, det finns lagar och de kommer förr eller senare att bli dyrare än det arbete man enkelt hade kunnat göra i tid.\n\nSom man brukar säga: *A stitch in time saves nine.* Inget kunde vara mer sant när det gäller IT-säkerhet.\n\n### **Tre sätt att tänka rätt om IT-säkerhet**\n\n**1. Separera rollerna – alltid**\n\nDen som driver affär eller utdelning ska inte också ansvara för att granska sig själv.\n\n**Rollseparering är grundläggande för trovärdig säkerhet.**\n\n**2. Lägg budget där ansvaret finns**\n\nOm säkerhetschefen bär det juridiska och operationella ansvaret, måste budgeten ligga hos dem.\n\n**Allt annat är ansvarsflykt.**\n\n**3. Ta säkerhet på allvar innan det smäller**\n\nAtt vänta på en incident, revision eller böter innan något händer är som att köpa brandförsäkring efter att huset brunnit ner.\n**Det kan stilla samvetet, men skadan är redan skedd och kundernas förtroende är svårt att reparera.**\n\nNär styrning och kontroll hamnar hos samma person uppstår en tyst risk som inte syns i rapporter eller dashboards.\n\nAtt anamma farfarsprincipen, fyra ögon för ett beslut, är klokt även här. Vilka beslut som innebär vilka risker tar vi och att vi gemensamt förstår dem. Men det viktigaste är kanske att inte samma person som tar ut utdelningen inte begränsar arbetet med att vara compliant. \n\nDet är då det händer:\n\n> Räven har redan tagit plats inne i hönshuset, och ingen vågar fråga vem som gav den nyckeln.\n> \n\nIngress:\n\n### **🦊 Räven vaktar hönshuset, om ansvarsflykt och IT-säkerhet**\n\nMånga företag bär redan på en tyst och osynlig risk.\n\nSäkerhetsarbetet är ofta reaktivt och reducerat till ett sidospår. Det prioriteras först när något redan har hänt, inte innan.\n\nEtt vanligt mönster är att ansvar, budget och kontroll samlas i samma händer. När fokus ligger på kortsiktiga resultat får det förebyggande arbetet stå tillbaka.\n\nDen långsiktiga stabiliteten förloras i jakten på nästa kvartalsrapport.\n\nNär räven vaktar hönshuset ser ingen att dörren står öppen.\n\nLäs hela artikeln på min substack\n\n[https://open.substack.com/pub/thomaslarsson/p/raven-vaktar-honshuset-om-ansvarsflykt?r=5kjx3a&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true](https://open.substack.com/pub/thomaslarsson/p/raven-vaktar-honshuset-om-ansvarsflykt?r=5kjx3a&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true)",

Läs på min Substack.\n\n**När AI förändrar spelplanen varje vecka, hur tänker du strategiskt och långsiktigt?**\n\nStrategi har aldrig handlat om att du ska förutspå framtiden. Det handlar om att förstå sin position på marknaden, sina egna förmågor och vad som håller på att förändras. AI har skruvat upp tempot: från årsplaner till något som knappt ens hinner bli veckoplaner. Det kräver ett annat tänk. Inte mindre strategi, men en som är mer lyhörd, mer hypotesdriven och betydligt mer snabbfotad.\n\nTraditionellt är strategi något som får ta tid. Du lägger månader på att komma fram till en plan som ofta sträcker sig över flera år. Den kan omprövas, men i grunden är den ett bet: “vi tror att det här är rätt riktning”.\n\nMen det fungerar inte längre på samma sätt.\n\nVi står inför något som i sin karaktär kanske påminner om när elektriciteten förändrade samhället. AI kommer påverka alla delar från hur beslut fattas, till hur kundvärde skapas och levereras. Djupet varierar, men bredden är omfattande.\n\nRedan idag skriver politiker beslutsunderlag med hjälp av AI. Många företag använder det i sin produktutveckling, kommunikation eller analys tyvärr ofta utan att ha en tydlig policy eller strategi. Men, hur ska du tänka då?\n\nPrecis som med andra tekniska möjliggörare behöver du fortfarande göra jobbet. Det nya är att AI:s förmåga förändras nästan från vecka till vecka. Det som var science fiction i april är vardag i juni.\n\nVi är mitt i ett VUCA-landskap:\n\nVolatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity.\n\n### **Vad kan du göra?**\n\nDet finns tre grundfrågor att börja med:\n\n1. **Vilka delar av er värdekedja kan påverkas?**\n    \n    Från råvara eller data, till leverans till slutkund. Vad förändras? Var?\n    \n2. **Hur förändras kundens beteende och förväntningar?**\n    \n    Vad händer när dina kunder själva använder AI snabbare än du?\n    \n3. **Vad är din faktiska förmåga att leverera kundvärde i det nya läget?**\n    \n    Vilka problem löser ni? Vilka borde ni lösa?\n    \n\nUtifrån det bygger du scenarier. Osäkra, gärna provocerande. Du börjar experimentera. Du lär medan du gör. Du går tillbaka till dina hypoteser.\n\nOfta.\n\nDu följer utvecklingen nära. Och du håller koll på aktörer som försöker förändra spelplanen helt, troligen med AI som sin utgångspunkt snarare än ett tillägg.\n\n### **Kort sagt:**\n\nStrategin idag är kanske att vara utforskande och extremt lyhörd.\n\nMen det betyder inte att du saknar riktning. Du har en hypotes. Du har en idé.\n\nSkillnaden är att du vet att det du planerar för idag kan vara irrelevant redan nästa vecka.\n\nSå sätt igång. Börja skapa hypoteser och experimentera! Lek 🙂\n\nPS. Jag experimenterar med Ai på daglig basis och “leker” med verktygen. Har såklart en idé men mycket handlar om att förstå vad som går och inte.\n\nEtt verktyg som är extra snällt är Airtable där man bygger en hel “applikation” ovanpå datat som är lätt att förstå och adderar Ai-möjligheter.\n\nSe några exempel vad som är gjort i deras [Ai-Playbook](https://www.airtable.com/ai-playbook).",

Because you’re tasked with predicting the future — and let’s face it, no one’s truly great at that.\nYour responsibility isn’t just to create a plan; it’s to prepare for the **unknowns**. You need to expect the unexpected — like packing a raincoat even when the forecast says sunshine.\nMost plans I see assume everything will go perfectly. That’s a mistake. As Maarten Dalmijn said, **“Don’t limit your plans to your current limited understanding of the situation.”**\nYou have to be ready to adapt your plan from day one. Dwight D. Eisenhower got it right: **“Plans are nothing; planning is everything.”**\nIt’s your duty to create scenarios and plan for different outcomes. This way, you’re not just predicting the future but preparing for multiple possibilities. Lao Tzu’s wisdom still holds: **“If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.”**\nSo, the next time you think, **“Now it’s just about execution,”** remember — it’s your responsibility to stay flexible because nothing ever goes exactly as planned.\n\nScenario\n\n### Planning: The Art of Predicting the Unpredictable\nPlanning is one of the most challenging disciplines you need to master. Why? Because it asks you to predict the future — and let’s face it, we humans aren’t exactly great at that.\nThe difference between a plan and a successful one lies in your ability to prepare for the\n\n**unknowns**\n\n— those unpredictable elements we can’t foresee. To navigate these uncertainties, you need to approach planning as we do with weather forecasting: with scenarios.\nImagine you’re planning a day out in nature. The weather forecast says there’s an 80% chance of sun, 10% chance of clouds, and 10% chance of rain. Even with a high probability of sun, you still pack a raincoat — just in case.\nYet, what surprises me is that most plans I see rarely include scenarios where things deviate from the initial understanding. They assume everything will go perfectly according to the baseline prediction.\nMaarten Dalmijn once said,\n\n**“Don’t limit your plans to your current limited understanding of the situation.”**\n\nThat line stuck with me.\nYour plan should probably be adjusted from the very first week. As Dwight D. Eisenhower wisely put it,\n\n**“Plans are nothing; planning is everything.”**\n\nWhen you incorporate scenarios into your planning, you’re not just predicting one future; you’re preparing for multiple possible outcomes. It’s like “cheating” at predicting the future — you’re planning for different versions of what might come next.\nA few thousand years ago, Lao Tzu wrote,\n\n**“If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.”**\n\nThe wisdom in that thought still holds true today.\nSo, the next time someone confidently says,\n\n**“Now it’s just about execution,”**\n\njust smile and face the reality — things will never go as planned.\n\n---\n\nThis revision enhances readability, highlights key points, and creates a smooth narrative flow that draws in the reader while still maintaining a conversational tone. It also strategically incorporates quotes to strengthen the message.\n\nPlanning is one of the most challenging disciplines that you can work with. Reason? You are asked to predict the future, and we humans suck at it.\nThe main difference between a plan and a successful one is being prepared for what you don’t know—or your unknowns unknowns. To handle that, you need to predict your plan as we predict the weather. With scenarios.\nSo you’re planning a day out in nature. The weather forecast is 80% sun, 10% cloudy, and 10% rain. Then, you pack a raincoat before heading out.\nWhat surprises me is that most plans I see seldom have a scenario where anything deviates from our current understanding.\nMaarten Dalmijn wrote something stuck: “Don’t limit your plans to your current limited understanding of the situation.”\nYou should be aware that the plan should probably be adjusted already from the first week, or as Dwight D. Eisenhower said, “Plans are nothing; planning is everything.”\nSo, if you put some scenarios in your plan and shift direction, you can predict the future better because you cheated. You are planning for different futures. A few thousand years ago, Lao Tzu wrote: “If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.”\nSo next time someone says, “Now it is only execution,” just smile and face reality; it will never go as planned anyway.",

För vissa skolpolitiker så behöver du backa till att en dator kan va bra å ha (det som kom 1950).\n\nI detta körkort för styrelsen och ledningsgrupper samt politiker så förstår de då förhoppningsvis både möjligheterna och hoten.\n\nEfter genomgång kan alla i samma ledningsgrupp göra egen analys i sitt kontext. Exempel:\n\nHur påverkar datorvana (inklusive flugor som internet och Ai) elevernas möjlighet att få jobb? Vad händer om eleverna inte kan datorer när de kommer ut i arbetslivet?\n\nOm våra konkurrenter använder Ai för att bli effektivare. Exempel så anställer inte Klarna fler och lutar sig åt vad Ai kan göra. Liknande tendenser finns hos Amazon, Microsoft, konsultfirmor, advokatbyråer i US. Vad händer för vår egna konkurrensmöjlighet om vi står och tittar på? Hinner vi ställa om? Kan vi idag nyfiket explorativt börja titta och starta idag för att skapa oss förståelse?\n\nOm politiker använder Ai för att skriva svar på förslag utan egen övertygelse hur påverkar det då demokrati? En mycket djupare fråga där resultatet inte nödvändigtvis behöver bli sämre. Men styr då Ai världen inklusive besluten? Är du konspirationsteoretiker så är steget inte långt, övriga som inte förstod det sista har mycket att lära vart vi är på väg.\n\nMånga tror att man kan styra och kanske bromsa utvecklingen. Kalle Eriksson, Umeå Universitet gör ett viktigt påstående i sin avhandling ”Politisering av automatisering” \n\n> Att inte föra ett sådant samtal vore faktiskt djupt odemokratiskt med tanke på vilken central roll tekniken kommit att spela för samhällets övergripande organisering.\n> \n\nTolkar det såhär:\n\nStadiet är samtal. Inte beslut om skärm skolan.\n\nStadiet är förstå. Inte förbjuda för att skydda arbetstillfällen.\n\nStadiet är skapa hypoteser. Inte regulera.\n\nDessa påstående utmanas på veckobasis då teknikutvecklingen går fort och när vår förståelse går från 0→1 så omvärderas ovanstående.\n\nSpelar det här någon som helst roll? Min övertygelse är att det gör det på ett grundläggande sätt som få har förstått.\n\nLinneuniversitet har en utbildning som riktar sig delvis till denna målgrupp.\n\n> Syftet med kursen ”Artificiell intelligens för Ledare” är att ge chefer, ledare och beslutsfattare en djupare förståelse för AI och öka förståelsen för möjligheter, svårigheter, nytta och risker kopplat till AI.\n> \n\nDock hade jag velat sett en utbildning som är mer kopplat till framtida utmaningar och hur en strategi i att nyttja Ai är en del av lösningen. Strategiarbete helt enkelt.\n\nVi är i stort behov av både en strategi och plan för hur vi ska se på teknikutveckling och just nu Ai i synnerhet.\n\nDet första vi gemensamt behöver göra är att komma till förståelse och egna insikter. Vi är än så länge mycket långt ifrån det så just nu svamlar de flesta.\n\nDe som vet ser att kejsaren har inga kläder.\n\nPs. Jobbar med Ai som verktyg dagligen ur ett arkitektoriskt, styrningsperspektiv och försöker förstå hur Ai kan än mer hjälpa oss se samband i data som vi själva är chanslösa att göra.\n\nHemma har mina tre barn tillgång till Chat GPT och vi pratar och leker rätt mycket med det.\n\nMin son är autistiskt med grav dyselexi och läsa är inte sättet han lär sig. Det är uppläsning och dialog med Chat GPT, YouTube videos samt summeringar med referenser i Perpexity. Har har nästan fotografiskt minne så de ämnen har gör kunskapsprov utan krav på att formulera meningar och skriva med penna (även finmotoriskt problem) så är det nästan alla rätt. Vi har dock lite problem med slöjd där läraren vägrar att släppa det skriftliga dokumenteringskravet. Hantverket? Mycket bra.\n\nPerioden nu för mina barn är liknande den som när min pappa drog hem en Apple Dator hem i mitten av 1980 talet som lite ersatte min Comondore 64.",

De utgår alltid från ett tydligt syfte — att driva beslut — och varje sida i en presentation fungerar som ett eget mikrokapitel i berättelsen. Det som gör McKinsey-formatet så effektivt är att det kombinerar analytisk stringens med visuellt lugn: inga onödiga effekter, inga lösa tankar, bara den logiska vägen till insikt och handling.\n\nKärnan är **”Pyramidprincipen”** (Barbara Minto): börja med slutsatsen, förklara huvudargumenten och stöd dem med fakta. Resultatet blir en presentation som talar direkt till beslutsfattare – snabbt, tydligt och med tyngd.\n\n---\n\n### **🔟 saker som gör McKinsey-presentationer unika**\n\n1. **En slutsats per sida** – varje slide har ett tydligt huvudbudskap, inte en lista av punkter.\n2. **Rubriker med mening** – rubrikerna är fullständiga meningar som uttrycker slutsatsen, inte bara ämnet.\n3. **Pyramidprincipen** – logisk struktur från huvudpoäng till underbyggda argument och evidens.\n4. **Evidensstyrd kommunikation** – alla påståenden backas upp med data, källor eller exempel.\n5. **Tydliga och enkla diagram** – visualiseringar används för att förtydliga, inte för att imponera.\n6. **Konsekvent informationshierarki** – läsaren leds från helhet till detalj utan förvirring.\n7. **Inga onödiga element** – all “chart junk” tas bort; endast det som stödjer budskapet får finnas kvar.\n8. **Diskret design** – lugna färger, tydliga kontraster, konsekvent typografi. Innehållet bär presentationen.\n9. **Klar koppling till affärsvärde** – varje insikt leder mot ett beslut, en rekommendation eller en förändring.\n10. **Berättande logik** – presentationen känns som en välskriven berättelse: situation → problem → analys → rekommendation → resultat .",

If your data isn’t helping you make decisions, that’s a problem you need to fix first.\n\nI prefer when there’s a clear workflow that connects insights directly to decision-making.

However, it’s crucial to remember that viewing the data is just a fraction of the workflow. The real value lies in using that data to drive transparent, actionable decisions.\n\n— org\nIf your analytics only shows numbers, you are doing it wrong\nAnalytics is a path towards a decision. And if you can’t make the decision based on the data, you need to fix that first.\nI like when there is clear Workflow when the insights from analysis is a part towards the descision.\nSo there would be a few things you need to concider:\n1. Can I trust the data?\n2. Can I take descision on this data?\n3. Is it hard to execute so that the desicion is transparent and on what data it is based?\nIf you answer no on any of these questions I would say you have anaytics. But you dont have a workflow that really drives a data-bases descision.\nIt is nowdays possible with tools like Airtable to get there.

However, he argued that the pursuit of peace and truth was being undermined by humankind’s old friends: superstition and pseudoscience.\n\nWithin a passage of the text that frequently goes viral, Sagan set out his pessimistic vision of where the US will go if it loses its admiration for reason, rationality, and open-minded thinking.\n\nIt reads: “I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.”\n\n“And when the dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites now down to 10 seconds or less, lowest-common-denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.”",

I think so, and one reason is that it required some effort.\nA problem today is that we get help producing massive amounts of poor-quality information and sending it to too many people. We also have the “luxury” of inviting a big meeting in teams just because I don’t have the time to write an easy-to-understand email.\nAi is making this worse.\nIf we set up some rules, we could cut 50% of our meeting times and 80% of what gets into our mailbox.\nSo, my 2 cents for a more uncluttered work-life and getting back to producing more quality stuff.\n\nOnly attend meetings where:\n- There is a clear agenda and desired outcome.\n- The meeting booker has summarised the background.\n- You have a clear role in how to contribute intentionally.\n\nDeclutter email:\n* Most important! Newer reply all.\n- Ask yourself, “Should I send this?”\n- Do all people need to be involved?\n- What am I trying to say intentionally?\n\nChat:\n- Restrict channels and discussions.\n- Is this channel a good way for my intentions?\n- There must be rules on when to use and when to not.\n- Try to remove email as a channel if you want to use chat.\n\nIf you use AI, ask it to summarise and strengthen your point, and learn when it suggests something that is an improvement.\nFrom time to time, evaluate whether you communicate intentionally. Start by looking at the email and chat sent last week.\nSo my question is, have you communicated intentionally?",

    "body": "A lot of car companies are soon going out of business\n\nFor a long time a Car manufacture had an advantage on the experiences on how to create cars when a new model should be invented. But now I see a big shift that the old structures are in the way. Just the notion that everything could be planned ahead when you create new EV-battieries, motors and the software, internetconnection and interaction changes in months not decades.\n\nOld organisations leans towards to have rigid plan, because that is how it always have been done.\n\nSo where does this leave us. As Ford CEO Jim Farley says in this interview. We need to proof that we can create proftible cars within 5 years. And today everything that has to do with a battery in a EV is made in China. And also invention of next gen battery is a Chineese invention and their IP.\n\nBesides that everything Ford and Volkswagen is putting into a car is often created by others such as Bosch, Panasonic and 100 of other vendors. Ford can’t change that software.\n\nIn China they change whatever they want, they produce it themself whithin a eco-network of business called China. Yeaph that is seen as ONE mission.\n\nWhat is the response?\n\nNot one thing.\n\nFirst is to remove every old thinking of management and start putting the doers into descision-making spots. What could be the risk of doing this? Well I see two outcome. Either you succed to respond and survive. Or you don’t. With today thinking there is only one outcome.\n\nThe second is to start owning your own supply chain. Either as a own company, see Tesla, or as a colongromat of Car Manufactors. Batteries can be created in other places. A lot of bets need to be made, but do it together, remember your competitor is whole China, not one Chinese car manufacture.\n\nThe third part is to self-sabotage your capability to do things. Don’t overthink everything. Test and do. Learn and redo. Germans problems isn’t engenering. It is overengenering management and relly on SAP. Everything that isn’t done by SAP is done in a PowerPoint and 100 of Excels to for every aspect of the organisation. It is inefficent, proon to errors, and gives almost 0 trust to a quick descision and gives paralyzes in the organisations.\n\nBut what do I know?\n\nI’m often just there to extingue a fire and very seldon anyone taking full responsibilty of the situation. I know management dosen’t.\n\nOften called leadership.",

Tjernobyl‑reaktorn sprängdes 26 april 1986 för att ett test kördes utan ordentlig genomlysning. I ditt kök kanske felet bara gör grytan för salt, men mönstret är likadant: avvikelser som fångas för sent, kostar.\n\nGenom att se hela kedjan av steg innan något händer skapar du möjlighet att vara proaktiv. Du samlar krav, granskar arbetssättet och fångar avvikelser tidigt. Varje kontrollpunkt är ett skyddsnät som hindrar små problem från att bli dyra incidenter.\n\nHur tänker man i system och vad skulle en definition kunna vara? Nedan, förenklat från Wikipedia.\n\n> Systemtänkande är ett sätt att förstå komplexa problem genom att se hur delar hänger ihop, istället för att bara titta på varje del för sig. Det hjälper oss att hitta bättre lösningar genom att förstå helheten.\n> \n\nMitt förslag är att du börja här:\n\n1. Lista fem moment som inte får fallera och beskriv rutinen för arbetet.\n2. Lägg till ett tydligt kontrollsteg för varje rutin: checklista, logg eller test.\n3. När något brister: gör en kort analys, åtgärda orsaken direkt och justera rutinen för att fånga problemen i förväg.\n\nSaker vi hittar kallas ibland för incidenter, problem eller findings.\n\nSkillnaden är ofta att vi hittar och rättar till saker när det händer (Ad-Hoc). När vi jobbar systematiskt så funderar vi först varför det händer. Sedan hur kunde vi upptäcka det i förväg och förhindra att det uppstår nästa gång. \n\nIbland är det inte viktigt. \n\nHärdsmälta kärnkraft, viktigt. \n\nOm maten hemma blir för salt hemma så inte lika viktigt.\n\nResultatet är färre akuta räddningsinsatser och mer förutsägbar drift.\n\nDu väljer kontrollen nu, innan nästa incident väljer åt dig.",

An operating model brings the business model to life; it executes the business model. \n\n- An enterprise operating model describes how the enterprise configures its capabilities to execute its actions to deliver business outcomes as defined in the business model.\n- An information and technology operating model represents how an organization orchestrates its IT capabilities to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\n*Source: Gartner Glossary*\n\n</aside>\n\nFrom Chat GPT\n\nhttps://chatgpt.com/c/676ec8b4-98e4-8013-a070-ae5289de96a8\n\nAn **operative model** (or operating model) is a blueprint for how an organization delivers value to its customers and achieves its business goals. It defines the structure, processes, people, technology, and information needed to execute the organization’s strategy effectively.\n\n### Core Components of an Operative Model\n\n1. **Value Delivery**: How the organization produces and delivers value to customers. This includes value streams, core capabilities, and the integration of resources.\n2. **Processes**: The workflows and activities that drive operations, including how tasks are structured, automated, and optimized.\n3. **Organization and Roles**: The structure of teams, departments, and roles, including reporting lines, decision-making authority, and governance.\n4. **Technology and Tools**: The systems, platforms, and tools that enable efficient operations and digital transformation.\n5. **People and Culture**: The workforce capabilities, skills, and behaviors required to support the organization's strategy and processes.\n6. **Information and Data**: How data is collected, managed, analyzed, and used to make informed decisions and drive outcomes.\n\n### Purpose of an Operative Model\n\nThe operative model acts as the \"engine room\" of a business, translating high-level strategy into practical, executable actions. It bridges the gap between strategic intent and day-to-day operations, ensuring that every part of the organization is aligned to achieve its goals.\n\n### Examples of Use\n\n- A **retail company** uses its operative model to streamline supply chain operations, from inventory management to customer delivery.\n- A **bank** defines customer-facing and internal processes (e.g., loan processing, customer onboarding) to optimize the customer journey.\n- A **tech company** structures its teams around value streams (e.g., product development, customer support) to improve innovation and agility.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\nA well-designed operative model ensures:\n\n- Efficient resource allocation\n- Consistent customer experience\n- Adaptability to changes in the market\n- Scalability for growth\n- Clear accountability and governance\n\nIn your context as a management consultant and enterprise architect, an operative model serves as a key framework to enable organizations to function effectively and achieve their desired outcomes.",

So how do we do that?\n\nTo learn or evolve a skill, it needs to be important or interesting.\n\nImportant is mostly basic stuff; think of the first steps in Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs.\n\nInteresting, is for yourself that you have potential to evolve with a lot of joy in the effort you put into mastery a skill.\n\nWhen you combine both, It is also very relevant for you.\n\nIn most traditional Martial arts, we also have grading with different belts. That is one goal to aspire to. It might be putting “senior” before your title in your context. For some, this is nonsense. For most, it is important.\n\nHow do you define your learning and evolving of your skills?\n\n# **Elevate Your Skills**\n\nEver wonder how to keep your skills sharp? Clint Eastwood once said, “Keep the old man out.” That’s been my mantra, especially now that I realise it’s not just about physical fitness but keeping all skills up to date.\n\nLearning or improving a skill boils down to two things: necessity and interest. The basics, like those first steps in Maslow’s hierarchy, are necessities. But your interest drives us to excel and find joy in mastering a skill.\n\nCombining both leads to actual relevance and growth.\n\nIn martial arts, the journey from one belt to the next symbolises progress. Similarly, adding “senior” to your title might mark your advancement in the professional world. While some may dismiss it, for many, it’s a milestone.\n\nMy goal is to be a healthy 70-year-old man who can play with my grandkids and still have a fighting chance with my son :-)\n\nHow do you approach skill development and continuous learning?",

It is what happens most between organizational parts and different entities, such as customer journeys and internal processes.\n\nEnterprise Architecture (EA) is a conceptual blueprint that defines the structure and operation of an organization. It provides a comprehensive framework for aligning an organization’s business processes, information systems, and technology infrastructure with its overall strategy and goals.Key aspects of Enterprise Architecture include:\n1. Purpose: EA aims to determine how an organization can effectively achieve its current and future objectives by analyzing, planning, designing, and implementing changes across the enterprise.\n2. Scope: While initially focused on IT, EA has expanded to encompass the entire business, ensuring alignment with digital transformation efforts.\n3. Components: EA typically consists of four main domains:\n1. Business Architecture: Focuses on business strategy, governance, and key processes\n2. Application Architecture: Deals with specific applications and their interactions\n3. Information Architecture: Addresses data assets and management\n4. Technology Architecture: Covers hardware, software, and network infrastructure\n4. Benefits:\n1. Improves communication and transparency across departments\n2. Identifies inefficiencies and opportunities for optimization\n3. Reduces complexity and enhances system interoperability\n4. Supports informed decision-making for IT investments\n5. Increases operational resilience and agility\n5. Process: EA involves creating a current state assessment, defining a desired future state, and developing a roadmap to bridge the gap between them.\n6. Tools: Enterprise Architects use various software tools for modeling, data management, and portfolio management to create and maintain the EA blueprint.\nEnterprise Architecture is not a one-time project but an ongoing practice that evolves with the organization. It provides a holistic view of the enterprise, helping to align technology investments with business objectives and guide the organization through complex transformations\n## Other references:\nDenna givetvis :-)\nhttps://miro.com/miroverse/business-map-template/\nSedan:\nhttps://youtu.be/9TVc32M_gIY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDI2oF1bASk\nhttps://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/business-capability",

Some people just love when things are messy and want to bring some order to the situation. Turns out I’m one of those guys. When things start to be in a good shape. I’m not interested anymore. I don’t really recommend that if you don’t love to be in those situations.\nThere have been many attempt to create a model to describe what to do when. How to describe something that is complex. And what does that really mean? I’m a big fan of Martin D work and how he try to simplify the world.\nWhen it comes around you need to choose two perspectives. In Stacey Matrix originated from Ralph Douglas Stacey he uses Agreement and Certainty.\n\n## Org. text\n\nThe original Stacey Matrix, developed by Ralph Douglas Stacey, helps organizations navigate complexity through two key dimensions: agreement and certainty. It was originally developed to makes sense of organizations and the mess that org design and theory seek to simplify. Many other versions have spawned from the original. Though not specifically for project delivery, it is highly relevant in that area as well. But there are others that have evolved over the last 25 years.\n\nAgreement and Certainty\n\nThe matrix is based on how much agreement exists on the project’s objectives and how certain the cause-and-effect relationships are. High certainty means past experience can guide future outcomes, while low certainty involves innovative, unclear cause-and-effect scenarios. Agreement reflects the level of consensus among stakeholders about the project’s goals and methods. Low agreement often demands negotiation and compromise.\n\n🔵 Stacey categorized complexity into five areas:\n\n✅ 1. Close to Agreement, Close to Certainty\n\nHere, cause-and-effect relationships are well understood, and agreement on objectives is high. Projects like construction and engineering fit this category, where past data helps predict outcomes. Monitoring detailed plans ensures control.\n\n✅ 2. Far from Agreement, Close to Certainty\n\nWhile objectives can be technically clear, there’s little consensus on their value. Conflicting stakeholder views can stall decisions. This requires political skills like negotiation, compromise, and coalition-building to move forward.\n\n✅ 3. Close to Agreement, Far from Certainty\n\nHere, agreement exists on the desired outcome, but uncertainty surrounds how to achieve it. The cause-and-effect relationships may be unclear. Flexibility is key as the project evolves. A shared vision and adaptable planning help navigate uncertainty.\n\n✅ 4. Zone of Complexity\n\nIn this zone, both low agreement and low certainty create a highly complex project. Poor decisions arise when outdated solutions are applied. Creativity, innovation, and adaptability are essential, and methods like systems thinking are useful here.\n\n✅ 5. Far from Agreement, Far from Certainty\n\nIn this chaotic zone, both agreement and certainty are lacking. Traditional management techniques often fail. Avoidance is common, but unsustainable. This zone requires flexible, creative solutions. The edge between chaos and complexity is where innovative problem-solving can occur.\n![[Pasted image 20241204062354.png]]\n\n## Reference:\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/thomasianwilson_the-original-stacey-matrix-developed-by-activity-7253414532998471680-dr3l?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\n]]",

Få är informationsdrivna.**\n\n### **Ingress**\n\nFöretag drunknar i data men törstar efter information. Ledningar jagar siffror men missar samband. De mäter rörelsen men förstår inte riktningen, och kallar det styrning.\n\nFöretag drunknar i data men törstar efter information. Ledningar jagar siffror men missar samband. De mäter rörelsen men förstår inte riktningen. Det ser ut som kontroll men det är sken. Alla pratar om data, visar dashboards och staplar rapporter i tron att mängden i sig ska skapa klarhet, men mer ljus hjälper inte om du tittar åt fel håll. Många ledningsgrupper misstar hög mätintensitet för styrning, fast siffrorna säger väldigt lite om varför något händer.\n\n> “Att vara datadriven utan att vara informationsdriven är som att ha radar utan skärm.”\n> \n\n> Du hör pipet, men du vet inte vad som närmar sig.\n> \n\nI praktiken betyder det här att många ledningsgrupper sitter med sina diagram och tolkar det som kontroll, men de betraktar bara effekter som redan har inträffat. De ser symptom, inte orsaker. De ser siffror, inte rörelsen som binder dem samman.\n\nGoodhart formulerade problemet för länge sedan:\n\n> “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”\n> \n\n> Goodhart’s Law\n> \n\nOch HBR satte fingret på nästa steg:\n\n> “The biggest mistake in performance management is confusing the measure with the mission.”\n> \n\n> Harvard Business Review\n> \n\nTillsammans beskriver de hur måttet förlorar sin precision, och hur riktningen förlorar sin mening, när organisationer börjar optimera siffror i stället för att förstå sin egen verksamhet. Därför växer KPI-programmen inte för att verksamheten blivit tydligare, utan för att osäkerheten ökar. Fler mått ersätter inte förståelse, de ersätter bara tystnaden mellan mötena.\n\n## **Från siffror till förståelse**\n\nData beskriver vad som händer, information beskriver varför det händer. Utan det varför som binder samman orsak och effekt saknar organisationer riktning.\n\nInformation skapas aldrig i Power BI som sådan, oavsett hur många dashboards som byggs. Den uppstår först när någon kan sätta siffrorna i ett sammanhang, se mönster över tid, och koppla ihop beteenden, kapacitet och system. Den som är informationsdriven frågar inte hur mycket data som finns, utan vilken förståelse som saknas för att fatta rätt beslut.\n\nDet är den här förmågan som avgör skillnaden. Datadrivet är att samla in. Informationsdrivet är att förstå. Organisationer misslyckas inte på grund av brist på data, utan på grund av brist på tolkning.\n\n## **Typfallet där allt ser rätt ut men inget stämmer**\n\nTypfallet upprepas i nästan alla större organisationer. Rapportpaketen växer, KPI-strukturen blir tyngre och dashboards fyller skärmar, men när något börjar gå fel finns det ingen gemensam bild av orsakerna. Alla pekar på olika mått. Alla gör egna tolkningar. Alla hittar sin egen del av sanningen.\n\nSystemen levererar data men ingen funktion lyckas skapa en begriplig helhet. Det är här gapet mellan datadrivet och informationsdrivet blir tydligt. Organisationen ser allt men förstår nästan inget. Det skapar reaktivitet, täta möten och fel beslut, inte på grund av att man saknar data, utan på grund av att man saknar en gemensam tolkning.\n\n## **Business Radar, det tolkande nervsystemet som saknas**\n\nHär behövs inte fler verktyg eller fler grafer. Här behövs någon som hjälper organisationen att skapa förståelse av allt data, någon som kan översätta signaler till information som går att använda i beslut.\n\nEn Business Radar är inte en rapport och inte ett system, utan en funktion. Ett tolkande organ som filtrerar bort bruset, visar vad som faktiskt rör sig, förklarar varför det rör sig och kopplar det till beslut, ansvar och konsekvens. Det är verksamhetens nervsystem, den plats där signalerna blir begripliga och där besluten får riktning.\n\nFöretag lägger stora investeringar på dataplattformar och visualiseringar men nästan ingenting på själva tolkningen. Det är som att köpa den bästa radarn och sedan glömma skärmen. Pip utan bild. Ljud utan riktning. Data utan information.\n\n## **Slutsats**\n\nFöretag drunknar i data men törstar efter information. Ledningar jagar siffror men missar samband. De mäter rörelsen men förstår inte riktningen.\n\nDet här handlar inte om teknik. Det handlar om tolkning, språk och mening. Det handlar om att navigera, inte bara mäta.\n\n> Alla vill bli datadrivna.\n> \n\n> Få är informationsdrivna.\n> \n\n> Möjligheten är att vara annorlunda, och börja med den information som faktiskt hjälper besluten.\n> \n\n## **Läs vidare**\n\nGoodhart’s Law\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\n\nHarvard Business Review, The Folly of Stretch Goals\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2019/05/the-folly-of-stretch-goals",

Hela verksamheten ned i mindre detaljer. Hur skulle det se ut om vi “lånade” uppifrån och detaljerar neråt?\n\n## **Syfte**\n\nDen här boken handlar om hur allt egentligen hänger ihop. Boken är för dig som sitter i ledningsgruppen, driver förändring eller försöker skapa nytta på riktigt. Du som vill slippa enbart en modell som lovar mycket men förklarar lite.\n\nFrån den första känslan av inspiration till de praktiska planerna som gör skillnad i verkligheten.\n\nDen startar med vilket värde vi vill skapa för omvärlden. En hel del arkitektur, men rör sig snabbt mot affärsutveckling, strategi och ledning, och slutar i de konkreta planerna som styr vad vi faktiskt gör. De flesta organisationer försöker hålla ihop helheten med ord, bilder och god vilja. Strategin hamnar i PowerPoint, processerna i Excel och arkitekturen i ett verktyg ingen öppnar. Det är inte illvilja, bara brist på struktur och gemensamt språk.\n\nDen här boken vill visa att det går att tänka och agera sammanhängande. Att beskriva verksamheten så att varje nivå – vision, mål och handling – hänger ihop. Att skapa ett språk där strategi och arkitektur blir två sidor av samma tanke: hur man faktiskt får något gjort.\n\nOch istället bygga något som håller, i tänkandet, i samtalet och i praktiken.\n\nDen är skriven för dig som är pragmatiker.\n\n## Upplägg\n\nVerksamheten består av verksamhetsförmågor som utför allt arbete i detta “ramverk”. All planering utgår från de övergripande styrmekanismerna. Till skillnad mot silotänk. Förmågorna ingår i sin tur i t.ex. värdeflöden, eller processer som beskriver vad vi vill uppnå.\n\nDet kluriga är att arbeta med beroenderna och relationerna och fundera på vilka forum som är lämpliga att diskutera de olika delarna och vad som är generellt vi aldrig vill tappa.

Summering av tidigare artiklar\n\nDina publicerade texter kretsar kring hur organisationer skapar verkligt värde genom att fokusera på förmågor, riktiga problem och lärande i små steg. Du utmanar övertron på processer och betonar att struktur ska stötta, inte styra, kreativt och komplext arbete. Flera artiklar visar hur ett problem‑först‑angreppssätt gör data och analys användbara i beslut, och hur berättelser om konkreta förbättringar bygger kultur. Du kopplar detta till strategi i snabb förändring, särskilt med AI, där hypoteser, scenarier och experiment krävs snarare än detaljerade planer. En återkommande röd tråd är ansvar och rollseparering inom säkerhet, samt systemtänkande för att bryta silos och undvika byråkrati som bromsar. Du framhåller tydliga definitioner, risktransparens och att vårda långsiktigt förtroende. Samtidigt lyfter du vikten av att skapa utrymme för de tystare rösterna och att använda inversion för att undvika fallgropar. Sammantaget handlar ditt författarskap om att göra organisationer mer relevanta, handlingskraftiga och lärande genom att styra mot förmågor och verkliga effekter.\n\n### 2.

Det är fel. Det som leder till resultat är människors möjlighet att göra jobbet, utan att trassla in sig i byråkrati.\n\nMen varför har vi processer då? Det enkla svaret: **för att förstå hur vi gör saker.** Och ibland, för att vi måste.\n\nTidigt i min karriär besökte jag Ericsson som projektledare. Deras projektmodell innehöll hundratals dokument. En av grundarna till modellen sa något jag aldrig glömt:\n\n> När du kommer in här som junior projektledare så försöker de flesta att försöka fylla i så många dokument som möjligt. Du är en fullständig idiot om du lyckas fylla i alla. Ditt uppdrag är att förstå vilken dokumentation som behövs för ditt projekt och din styrgrupp.\n> \n\nJag lovade att aldrig avslöja vem som sa det.\n\nSedan dess har jag haft samma syn på det mesta i arbetslivet, inklusive nyttan med alla modeller och processer i synnerhet.\n\n**Processer behövs, men bara om de gör nytta.**\n\n- Ska du stänga av kyla i ett kärnkraftverk? Ja, då ska det finnas en process.\n- Ska du hantera personuppgifter? Absolut.\n- Ska du skicka kod till produktion? Självklart.\n\nDär krävs förståelse, spårbarhet, säkerhet. Men det finns en gräns. Och den passeras ofta.\n\nSärskilt i “kreativa processer”. De bästa jag jobbat med i reklambranschen har ingen formell process. De bara gör. Försök få dem att “följa en mall” och du dödar exakt det som gör dem bäst. Det är en tunn linje mellan geni och…\n\nDet gäller även i andra yrken. Det som ser ut som kaos utifrån kan vara en inre precision, men en som inte låter sig formaliseras.\n\nSå varför försöker vi ändå pressa in människor i processer?\n\nKanske för att vi är rädda. Rädda för misstag. Rädda för ansvar.\n\nKanske för att det känns tryggare med en mall än att lita på kompetens.\n\nNågon sa:\n\n> Den enda process du behöver är den som förbättrar processen.\n> \n\nDet är förstås en paradox. Men det finns en del sanning i den om du reflekterar över den. Har du en sådan?\n\nTre påstående från mig:\n\n- De flesta processer ska vara vägledande.\n- Vissa processer är obligatoriska.

    "body": "# **Signal eller brus**\n\n![Brus-Signal.png](Signal%20eller%20brus/Brus-Signal.png)\n\nI förra artikeln beskrev jag skillnaden mellan data och information. Det är en nödvändig grund, men den räcker inte. Nästa fråga är ännu mer avgörande. Hur vet vi om det vi ser är en verklig förändring eller bara brus som råkar låta?\n\nDe flesta verksamheter reagerar på rörelser i siffrorna. Grafer svänger upp och ner och ledningen tolkar det som att något håller på att hända. Men variation är inte samma sak som rörelse. En kurva kan skifta utan att verkligheten gör det. Ett index kan hoppa utan att verksamheten påverkas. Ett KPI kan slå av orsaker som inte säger någonting alls om läget.\n\nDet är därför så många planeringscykler faller på samma sak. Ledningen försöker förklara varför något rör sig, trots att mönstret inte bär någon mening. Man misstolkar brus som om det vore signal och man missar signaler som rör sig långsamt men med konsekvens. Utan att någon egentligen har ansvar för att skilja det ena från det andra. Det är inte datan som skapar osäkerhet. Det är tolkningen av den.\n\n> Det mesta som rör sig i siffrorna betyder ingenting.\n> \n> \n> Ser du signalerna, eller reagerar du på allt brus?\n> \n\nDet är den distinktionen som saknas i nästan alla verksamheter och därför blir allt viktigt. Allt bråttom. Allt en avvikelse. I praktiken betyder det att inget blir prioriterat.\n\nEtt aktuellt exempel visar hur det här ser ut i verkligheten. Trelleborg AB rapporterade i april 2025 att de ännu inte [drabbats hårt av de amerikanska tullarna](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trelleborg-adjust-prices-production-offset-limited-tariff-impact-2025-04-24/), men att de indirekta effekterna redan syns i råmaterial, ledtider och värdekedjor. Det är en signal. Inte för att siffrorna rört sig, utan för att rörelsen betyder något. När grundförutsättningarna förändras långsamt är det lätt att missa skiftningen om man inte har en funktion som tolkar den över tid.\n\nFör svensk tillverkningsverksamhet är detta inte en datapunkt. Det är en signal. Och industriförändringar startar nästan alltid så. Små förskjutningar först. Konsekvenser senare. Ett brus däremot är allt det andra som råkar röra sig i diagrammet utan att förutsättningarna ändras.\n\nVarför feltolkar organisationer detta? För att systemen är byggda för att visa utfall, inte för att förklara mening. Inte heller jobbar vi med att förklaringen inte alltid är helt korrekt och scenarion behövs för att använda flera alternativ. En av anledningarna att vi går fel är att kultur ofta belönar snabb reaktion i stället för korrekt analys. För att dashboards är skapade för presentation snarare än styrning. Och framför allt för att ingen har uppdraget att avgöra vad som faktiskt betyder något.\n\n*Om man börjar med att skilja signal från brus går det också att förstå vilka verkliga problem verksamheten har. Först då kan man se vad signalerna betyder och vad man ska göra åt dem. I min artikel “[Att bli datadriven börjar med ett problem, inte med ett verktyg](https://thomaslarsson.substack.com/p/datadriven-kultur-borjar-inte-med)” utvecklar jag den principen vidare.*\n\n> Beslut blir bättre först när du slutar lyssna på bruset och börjar se signalerna.\n> \n\nResultatet blir ett konstant reaktivt beteende där verksamheten springer på allt och missar det som verkligen ändrar spelplanen.\n\nHär behövs en **Business Radar**. Inte som ännu ett lager visualisering, utan som en faktisk förmåga att avgöra om något kräver handling. Radarn hjälper verksamheten att se vad som är en verklig förskjutning och vad som är irrelevant rörelse. Den beskriver orsaken, inte bara utfallen. Den kopplar signalerna till beslut, konsekvens och ansvar. Den skapar riktning i ett läge där allt annars låter lika mycket.\n\nNär världen förändras långsamt är det varje dag svårt att se vad som spelar roll. Men när förändringen väl blivit tydlig är det för sent att agera. Signal eller brus är därför inte en teknisk fråga. Det är en ledningsfråga. Det avgör om verksamheten ligger före sin egen verklighet eller hamnar efter den.\n\n> Ser vi signalerna. Eller lyssnar vi bara på bruset.\n> \n\nEn stor konkurrensfördel, tror jag, är inte vem som har mest data, utan vem som först förstår vad som faktiskt betyder något och agerar på korrekt information. Du kan helt enkelt skilja på brus och signal.\n\n---\n\nPs: I nästa artikel utforskar vi hur en Business Radar kan se ut rent praktiskt med faktiska exempel. Prenumera på min Substack så du inte missar den. Ds.\n\n______\n\n# Teaser - LinkedIn\n\nDet mesta som rör sig i era siffror betyder ingenting. Ändå reagerar de flesta organisationer på varje mikroförändring i ett KPI. Man misstolkar brus som signaler och missar de rörelser som verkligen betyder något.\n\nNär allt blir viktigt blir inget prioriterat.\n\nSignal eller brus är inte en teknisk fråga.

That is the Exploitation part of our Strategy.\n\nBut they also exist within the Next Competitive Advantage, that we must incubate and bring to commercial viability AROUND the next industry inflection point. That is the Exploration part of our Strategy.\n\nTwo parts of our Strategy? That's why it's called an Ambidextrous Strategy.\n\nTHE ACTIVITY SYSTEMS\n\nNow, what did we say that a Value Proposition is? Before\n\n[**Tony Ulwick**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyulwick/)\n\nand the late Clayton Christensen coined the Jobs-to-Be-Done concept, the definition provided by Prof.\n\n[**Michael Porter**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/professorporter/)\n\nseemed fine: \"The Value Proposition is the answer to three questions: 'What customers?', 'Which needs?', and 'What relative price?'\"\n\nBut Clayton Christensen used to say: \"The he Customer is the wrong unit of analysis. It's the Job that we must understand ... \". Tony Ulwick would say that it's even more than that ... It's about the 'customer outcomes' of those Jobs.\n\nBut then we look at the Activity System, a concept defined by Prof. Porter as a mutually-reinforcing set of Essential Factors and Tradeoff Factors that make a Value Proposition successful. Why is that? Because (a) both types of factors are derived from the Strategic Choices and (b) they are further turned into Products and Services by the Product/Service Development (a Marketing department function), once the execution of our Strategy sets in place the Capabilities required to support those factors.\n\nACTIVITY SYSTEM\n\n[**https://lnkd.in/dUqAH4hS**](https://lnkd.in/dUqAH4hS)\n\nTHE STRATEGY BACKBONE\n\nThe Value Propositions, illustrated by their Activity Systems, require a number of supporting Capabilities to be in place, because without them, those Essential & Tradeoff Factors won't move from the whiteboard into the market reality.

Få är [datadrivna](https://thomaslarsson.substack.com/p/alla-vill-bli-datadrivna-fa-ar-informationsdrivn), [signal-eller-brus](https://thomaslarsson.substack.com/p/signal-eller-brus).\n\nVi drunknar i dashboards. Ändå saknar vi en bild av det som betyder något. Vi har staplar, färger, grafer och KPI:er i överflöd, men det viktigaste, det som borde styra våra beslut, förblir osynligt. Att leda utan analys är som att sitta vid radarn utan skärm, siffrorna rör sig, men världen ligger i mörker. Det är här våra beslut faller. Inte på bristen av data, utan på bristen av förståelse.\n\nDet märks tydligast i planeringscyklerna. Varje år diskuterar vi investeringar, satsningar, risker och prioriteringar. Det ser ut som ett strukturerat arbete, men under ytan är det samma mönster. Antaganden som staplas på antaganden. Gissningar som letas upp i gamla filer. Känsloargument som maskeras som siffror. Vi mäter mer än någonsin, men förstår mindre än vi vågar erkänna.\n\nDet här är inte individers fel. Det är ett systemfel. I militär underrättelse är rådata värdelös utan analys, det är tolkningen som räddar liv. I våra verksamheter gör vi motsatsen, vi levererar rådata till ledningsgrupper och hoppas att någon ska se mönstret. Vi ersatte underrättelse med instrumentpaneler. Vi slutade fråga vad informationen betyder och började istället visa hur mycket vi kan mäta.\n\nSamtidigt pratar vi allt mer om Human in the Loop inom AI, men sanningen är att människan alltid behövts i loopen. Inte för att ersätta tekniken, utan för att ge den mening. I BI har vi rationaliserat bort de människor som kan analys och försökt ersätta dem med dashboards. Vi tror att snygga grafer är ett tecken på förståelse, när de ofta döljer frånvaron av den. Forskningen skiljer tydligt på kvantitativt och kvalitativt data, men i våra organisationer behandlas allt som siffror. Det kvalitativa, varför något händer och vad det betyder, lämnas till intuition eller slumpen. Och det är här besluten börjar falla isär.\n\n## **Den nya regeln**\n\n> Om en datapunkt är med i en analys så kräver det en tolkning.\n> \n> \n> Och varje tolkning behöver följas av en rekommendation**.**\n> \n\nDet är fundamentet i en Business Radar. Det är så en President Brief fungerar och det är så underrättelsearbete fungerar. Data är råmaterialet, analysen är verktyget och rekommendationen är rörelsen. Det är inte en ny metod, det är återställningen av en disciplin vi tappat. Rapporten är inte dokumentation, den är beslutsunderlag.\n\nRapporter finns i många former. Men ytterst ska de hjälpa beslutsfattare att ta mer välgrundade beslut. Likt denna som kommer varje dag till USA:s president sedan 1960 talet.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7ooY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa6fb857-a4d6-464d-990c-3439a3232bef_1000x563.png)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## **Beslutsmekaniken förändras**\n\nNär denna princip får fäste händer något direkt i organisationen. Besluten förändras. De blir snabbare och stabilare. Mindre känslostyrda, mer konsekventa. Mindre isolerade, mer sammanhängande. Det liknar [OODA-loopens rytm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop). *Observera, orientera, besluta, agera.* I många företag hoppar man direkt från observation till beslut, utan orientering. Det är där gissningarna föds. Med en Business Radar kommer orienteringen tillbaka. Vad betyder detta, vilka mönster ser vi, vilka alternativ finns.\n\nInnan vi går in i de konkreta exemplen behöver vi se hur en radarbild faktiskt ser ut när den sammanställs. Det här är indexet. Översikten. Organisationskartan. Den gemensamma skärmen.\n\nDen besvarar följande delar:\n\n**Område:** Vad vi bevakar!\n\n- Trend: Klassificering av hur området rör sig\n- Signal: Det som har hänt\n- Effekt: Vad det innebär\n- Behov: Vad vi ska göra åt det\n\n---\n\n## **Business Radar Index**\n\n**Leverantörsled**\n\n- Trend: kritisk\n- Signal: containerkostnader upp 6 procent\n- Effekt: marginalpress på 0,9 procentenheter\n- Behov: justerade offerter och kostnadsscenarier\n\n**Global handel och råmaterial**\n\n- Trend: kritisk\n- Signal: indirekta tull-effekter i leverantörskedjan\n- Effekt: kostnadsvolatilitet och 10 till 25 procent längre ledtider\n- Behov: scenarioanalys och buffertanpassning\n\n**Marknad**\n\n- Trend: varning\n- Signal: covid-relaterad efterfrågechock som fortfarande påverkar investeringsbeslut\n- Effekt: orderfluktuationer och förskjutna planeringshorisonter\n- Behov: tätare marknadsuppföljning\n\n**Governance, Risk och Compliance**\n\n- Trend: kritisk\n- Signal: GDPR och Schrems II begränsar amerikanska molntjänster\n- Effekt: risk för vite, driftstopp och tvingad migrering\n- Behov: datakartläggning, riskklassning och alternativa driftmodeller\n\n**Personal**\n\n- Trend: neutral\n- Signal: kapacitetsluckor genom avgångar eller långsam rekrytering\n- Effekt: risk för leveransförseningar under Q3\n- Behov: snabbare tillsättningsplaner och interimstöd\n\n**Teknik och digitalisering**\n\n- Trend: stabil\n- Signal: ERP-migrering genomförd\n- Effekt: ingen akut påverkan men ny beroendepunkt\n- Behov: stabiliseringsperiod och övervakning\n\n---\n\nDet är detta dashboarden aldrig fångar.\n\nDashboards mäter.\n\nRadar orienterar.\n\nNu går vi vidare till tre faktiska exempel som visar hur radartänket fungerar i praktiken.\n\n## **Exempel 1**\n\nEn liten kostnadsökning som äter marginalen.\n\nUnder Q2 2024 steg containerpriserna från Asien med 6 procent. I BI-systemet såg det ut som en marginell rörelse, för liten för att generera uppmärksamhet. I verkligheten innebar rörelsen en marginalpress på 0,9 procentenheter på ett svenskt industriföretags största kundportfölj. Fraktkostnaden landar precis före marginalräkningen och förstärker därför små kostnadsförändringar.\n\n- **Signal:** Fraktkostnader upp 6 procent\n- **Bedömning:** Kostnaden förstärker marginaleffekterna\n- **Konsekvens:** Marginalpress 0,9 procentenheter. Fel prognoser och fel offerter\n- **Rekommendation:** Veckovis transportanalys. Justerade offerter. Nya kostnadsscenarier\n\n## **Exempel 2**\n\nTrelleborg och de indirekta effekterna av globala tullar.\n\nNär Trelleborg AB kommenterade effekterna av de amerikanska tullarna våren 2025 beskrev de den direkta effekten som liten, men varnade för betydande indirekta effekter i leverantörskedjan. Det var inte tullsatsen i sig som var problemet, utan vad den gjorde med råmaterialkostnader och ledtider.\n\n- **Signal:** Globala tullbeslut skapar störningar. Trelleborg lyfter risk för kostnadsökningar\n- **Källa:** Reuters, 24 april 2025\n- [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/trelleborg-adjust-prices-production-offset-limited-tariff-impact-2025-04-24/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/trelleborg-adjust-prices-production-offset-limited-tariff-impact-2025-04-24/)\n- **Bedömning:** Svenska industribolag riskerar kostnadsvolatilitet\n- **Konsekvens:** Marginalpress upp till 1,4 procentenheter. Längre ledtider\n- **Rekommendation:** Scenarioanalys. Flexibla avtal. Uppdaterad prissättning. Större bufferstock\n\n## **Exempel 3**\n\nGDPR och amerikanska molntjänster, en osynlig risk\n\nSvenska företag som använder amerikanska molntjänster ser inga varningar i KPI:er. Ingen dashboard signalerar risk. Men GDPR och Schrems II innebär att tjänster som AWS, Azure, Google Cloud eller ChatGPT kan vara otillåtna för vissa datatyper om inte rätt skydd finns.\n\n- **Signal:** GDPR och Schrems II begränsar amerikanska molntjänster\n- **Bedömning:** Företag riskerar vite, driftstopp eller tvingad migrering\n- **Konsekvens:** Stoppade system. Sanktioner. Miljonkostnader i omställning\n- **Rekommendation:** Kartläggning av datatyper. Riskklassning. Kryptering. Alternativ driftstrategi\n\n## **Slutlinje**\n\n> Ni behöver inte mer data.\n> \n> \n> Ni behöver en radar.\n> \n> Resten är gissningar.\n> \n\nDet är dags att stoppa in en “human-in-the-loop” igen och göra analyserna.\n\nLinkedIn\n\nDet är därför besluten bygger på antaganden.\n\nBI mäter.\n\nMen ingen tolkar.\n\nI min nya artikel visar jag tre verkliga exempel på varför vi behöver en Business Radar:\n\n- En liten fraktkostnad som slog ut marginalen\n- Trelleborgs dolda kostnadsrisker\n- GDPR som osynlig molnfälla\n\nDet handlar inte om mer data.\n\nDet handlar om att förstå data.\n\nLänk till artikeln på Substack:\n\n[**https://lnkd.in/dC56ZK4e**](https://lnkd.in/dC56ZK4e)",

Let’s explore the key differences:\n\n## Complicated Systems\n\nComplicated systems are characterized by:\n\n1. **Predictability**: While they may have many parts or steps, complicated systems generally follow predictable patterns[1][3].\n2. **Solvability**: They have defined solutions that can be reached through conventional strategies and thinking[2].\n3. **Structured nature**: Complicated systems are often layered and intricate, but follow a structured approach[3].\n4. **Expertise requirement**: They may require specialized knowledge or skills to navigate, but can be mastered with time and effort[4].\n\n**Example**: Filing taxes is complicated. It involves many steps and requires specialized knowledge, but follows a structured process with predictable outcomes[3].\n\n## Complex Systems\n\nComplex systems are characterized by:\n\n1. **Unpredictability**: They involve many interconnected parts that interact in ways that are difficult to predict or control[1][2].\n2. **Emergence**: New properties or behaviors can emerge from the interactions of the parts, which are not present in any single element[2].\n3. **Adaptability**: Complex systems often require innovative or customized approaches to navigate[3].\n4. **Contextual dependency**: The specific details and situations surrounding a complex system make it unique and often atypical[3].\n\n**Example**: Job searching is complex. While there are standard strategies, success depends on many unique factors like skill level, industry trends, and economic conditions[3].\n\n## Key Differences\n\n1. **Solution approach**: Complicated problems can often be solved with standard, predictable plans. Complex problems require customized, adaptive approaches[2][3].\n2. **Predictability**: Complicated systems, while difficult, are generally predictable. Complex systems are inherently unpredictable due to their many interacting elements[1][2].\n3. **Learning curve**: Complicated systems can be mastered with time and effort. Complex systems require ongoing adaptation and learning[4].\n4. **Perception**: People who prefer complicated tasks may find complex situations unclear or confusing, while those who enjoy complexity might find purely complicated tasks tedious[4].\n\nUnderstanding this distinction can be crucial in various fields, from problem-solving to career planning, as it helps in choosing appropriate strategies and approaches for different types of challenges.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/ENGLISH/comments/1cxajiw/whats_the_difference_between_complex_and/\n[2] https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/complexity-vs-complication-benjamin-sangwa\n[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNOA8OtKOE4\n[4] https://ultrathriving.com/articles/difference-between-complex-and-complicated/\n[5] https://nocomplexity.com/complex-vs-complicated/\n[6] https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-critical-difference-between-complex-and-complicated/\n[7] https://www.squawkpoint.com/2012/02/simple-versus-simplistic/\n[8] https://arkeagency.com/news/dave-trott-at-brightonseo/",

But we’re using cybernetics and control theory which are still theories of controlling variation and responding to negative feedback. We may be exchanging one view on predictability, with another view which equates to “predictably variable”.\n\nEven the idea of “wiring” an organization is highly grounded in that theory – kind of polymorphising organizations to represent things, when in fact all you have at the end of the day or humans and their actions creating population-level effects that appear to have the characteristics of “a system”.\n\nSo, thinking…. organizations don’t really set themselves up for anything. The people in organizations set themselves up for things. We have to think about power, influence, needs, etc.\n\nAnd what we see lately are people in power setting up organizations that may be perfectly suited to *their* needs, and may in fact conform to the theories of how organizations are set up for novel knowledge work (from an information flow standpoint), but in the end be entirely unsuitable for the humans working in those environments.\n\nOrganisations don’t really set themselves up for anything.\nThe people in organisations set themselves up for things.\n- John Cutler\n\nI do comparisson towards the military where the goal have been to defend a place or defeat an emeny. In the Veitamn War US was on the paper superior the avisory. All the theory on how to make a warfare where there. They even had hignly educated academic who know how in theory be at war.\nBut it failed.\nSpectactally.\nReason?\nAs Dwight D Eseinhover said.\nPlanning is everything.\nPlanning is worthless.\n\nSo, I think we need to create structure, processes, teams, and organisation to prepare us for things. We should train, but this only supports what comes next.\nReality.\nThere we need people who do things.\nAnd if not people are in sync with the structure that is in place and training on scenarios what can happens it doesent matter. But if there is a sync you can call everything that is set up as one word.\nSystem.",

Kina jobbar med att förverkliga planen för kommande 50 åren.\n\n# Så vad gör Kina rätt idag?\n\nJag utelämnar dess tillkortakommanden om demokrati, yttrandefrihet och väst syn på mänskliga rättigheter.\n\nKina lyckas för att de kombinerar **långsiktig planekonomi med teknologisk acceleration** – de ser ekonomi som strategi, inte marknad. Där väst byter riktning vart fjärde år, arbetar Kina metodiskt mot ett 50 års mål och ett 500-års mål: att återta sin historiska roll som världens centrum genom **teknologisk dominans, ideologisk stabilitet och ekonomiskt inflytande snarare än militär makt.** \n\nMest humor är när vi i väst försöker sätta en “näsbränna” på Kina och får det här [svaret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=8jZ0KTRUgpU).\n\n## **Långsiktighet som system, inte slogan**\n\nKina arbetar inte med valcykler, de arbetar med generationer.\n\n> I Kina kan man ändra policies, inte partier.\nI väst kan man ändra parti, men inte policies.\n> \n\nVarje stor satsning inom AI, energi och infrastruktur är en del i en större plan.\n\nDe bygger kapacitet, inte opinion.\n\nToyota hade som långsiktigt mål att bli världens största bilföretag för 50 år sedan. Japan var tidigare den asiatiska symbolen för långsiktighet, Kina har nu tagit över den rollen. Fords VD kom tillbaka efter [en resa i Kina](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amprather_ford-ceo-jim-farley-returned-from-a-recent-activity-7383155351631872000-1vrq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABYo3YBpNFn3EjbVJxuiB6CdYLSNw26-uA) och inser ödmjukt att det kommer krävas stora investeringar och samarbeten för att ens vara ett bilföretag inom några år. 80% av alla batterier görs i Kina. Dessutom har de tekniker på nästa generation av batterier som inte ens Tesla har, som gör batterierna mycket mer effektiva = billigare.\n\n## **Samordning mellan stat, industri och forskning**\n\nDet som kallas samarbete i väst är styrning i Kina.\n\nNär staten, industrin och universiteten delar mål, data och finansiering, går det fort.\n\nDet jag kanske är mest imponerad över, vilket inte skulle fungera i väst, är att när flera bolag tillsammans kan skapa något mer unikt med sammanhållande värdekedjor, då slås de ihop. Oavsett om det är akademin eller kommersiella företag.\n\nForskning blir produkter, inte rapporter.\n\n## **Infrastruktur som maktmedel**\n\nDet här har USA jobbat med under stor del av 1900 talet. Men vi ser ett tydligt skifte där USA backar och Kina flyttar fram sina positioner.\n\n[Belt and Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) är inte bistånd. Det är ett globalt operativsystem där inflytandet över mineraler kommer från vilka som investerat långsiktigt i infrastruktur och senare får skörda frukterna. Tänk Afrika, med kontroll över mineraler som litium och kobolt.\n\nKina äger kablar, hamnar och datanoder. Handel blir inflytande.\n\nKan då EU göra något åt saken?\n\n# **EU behöver bli radikalt annorlunda med tre prioriteringar**\n\n## **Skala investeringarna rejält och långsiktigt**\n\nEU har idag en strategi för grön och digital omställning. Men analyser visar att industrin inte förändrats grundläggande och att Europas konkurrenskraft riskerar att försvagas om inte investeringar och strukturförändringar sker.\n\n> Kort sagt: Gör satsningarna större och med längre horisont och inkludera redan etablerade företag.\n> \n\nMen vi har tyvärr ett problem med lågt förtroende för investeringar av “nya” bolag. T.ex. Northvolt och Stegra. Snygga presentationer. Tror mer på att gå tillbaka till gemensam innovation mellan etablerade spelare med antingen Svenska, EU ägande (om man nu vill motverka Kinesiskt, US inflytande). Exempel är ABB, Ericsson, Scania, SKF, SAAB för att nämna några. \n\nHela EU saknar dock en Tech Jugernaut. Vi har alternativ inom EU men inte på den skala vi skulle behöva. Jag är dock stor förespråkade open source, Linux är ett exempel.\n\nDe europeiska konkurrenterna till Google, Microsoft och Amazon AWS utgörs främst av **OVHcloud, Scaleway, Hetzner, Ionos och STACKIT**, som alla satsar på **molntjänster med europeisk data­suveränitet, lokal drift och enklare prissättning,** men ännu utan den globala skala och tjänstebredd som de amerikanska hyperscalers har. Här har EU startat med att investera [200 miljarder Euro i AI](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_467).  Men ekosystemet är fortfarande fragmenterat. Har sett få skisser på ett fungerande system.\n\nMånga är oroliga för att använda Kinesisk teknologi, vilket är berättigat. Men att ge Carte Blache till USA har visat sig svårt det med. Schrems II ett exempel. [Internationella brottsmålsdomstolen väljer annan leverantör](https://computersweden.se/article/4082532/internationella-brottmalsdomstolen-gor-sig-av-med-microsoft.html) än Microsoft då deras mejlkonto sängts av Politiska skäl. Politiska skäl, för en domstol?\n\n## **Fokusera på strategiska värdekedjor och kapaciteter**\n\nEU-forskning visar behov av att identifiera sektorer där man måste vara konkurrenskraftig t.ex. halvledare, batterier, kraftnät, digital infrastruktur.\n\n> Inte ”allt”, utan de områden där vi kan spela globalt och där beroenden mot andra gör oss sårbara.\n> \n\nKina bygger nu både helt egna operativsystem som redan används i alla devicer (telefoner, datorer, paddor) och bilar som tillverkas av Kina. Toyota använder deras [operativsystem](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/28/asia_tech_news_in_brief/) för alla bilar som säljs i Kina.\n\nSamma sak gäller Kinas satsning på mikroprocessorer (Nivida, Intel). Där vill man göra sig oberoende av resten av världen på alla nivåer av chips. Det finns redan “förbud” inom Kina där man [inte tillåter västerländska](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/top-china-silicon-figure-calls-on-country-to-stop-using-nvidia-gpus-for-ai-says-current-ai-development-model-could-become-lethal-if-not-addressed) chips i produkter från Kina.\n\n## **Förbättra koordinering och styrning, från ambition till genomförande**\n\nÄven när strategier finns inom EU, pekar experter på att styrning, institutionell uppbyggnad och finansiering är fragmenterade.\n\n> Om vi har ritningarna, måste vi också ha byggarbetarna, verktygen och ett fungerande bygge, inte bara planeringsmöten eller inskränkningar i länders självbestämmande.\n> \n\nDet som helt saknas är gemensamma strategier värt namnet.\n\nRekommendera att läsa en bok på strategi för de som jobbar inom EU på det här ämnet. \n\nOm länder inom EU ska behålla relevans är det dags att på riktigt se över vårt egna hus. Globaliseringen har en baksida. Det heter beroenden. Ska vi bryta det så behöver vi tillverka det vi själv behöver. Gärna av medlemsstater inom EU.\n\nDet är, enligt mig, ett av EU:s viktigaste fokusområden kommande 20 åren.\n\nBlinkning till annan slogan ”Make Europe great again”.\n\nJag trodde länge att väst hade receptet på framgång: innovation, frihet och snabb förändring.\nMen efter att ha arbetat med kinesiska team i sex år inser jag att deras styrka ligger i något helt annat. Långsiktighet, samordning och målmedvetenhet. Här är min reflektion om varför Kina springer ifrån oss, och vad EU skulle kunna göra anorlunda.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/aaSHXvzsq7k\n\nChina.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/amprather_ford-ceo-jim-farley-returned-from-a-recent-activity-7383155351631872000-1vrq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABYo3YBpNFn3EjbVJxuiB6CdYLSNw26-uA\n\n# Summary of previous thoughts\n\nChina’s emerging superpower status in your writing rests on five reinforcing pillars:\n\n- Long-horizon coordination and execution: A 30–50 year strategic arc enables compounding advantages versus election-cycle planning in the West.\n- Industrial integration and speed: Tighter coupling of design, supply chain, and advanced automation allows rapid iteration and cost, quality, and time-to-market leadership, clearly visible in autos.\n- Digital infrastructure for scale: State-backed platforms, including payments and data rails, compress transaction costs and cycle times, increasing system throughput.\n- Strategic tech focus: Concentrated investment in core technologies translates strategy into manufacturable capability, not only research outputs.\n- Pragmatic governance for outcomes: Fewer bureaucratic handoffs and less tolerance for managerial comfort zones reduce drag, enabling decisive shifts.\n\nImplication: Without comparable strategic coherence, Europe risks path dependence and incrementalism while China compounds advantages in cost, quality, and innovation velocity. This calls for capability-centric execution, governance that rewards speed-to-learning, and industrial policies that unlock integrated build-measure-learn loops at national and sector levels.\n\n# Reference\n\n- [Ford CEO Jim Farley returned from a recent trip to China “humbled” — stunned by how far Chinese automakers have surged ahead in cost, quality, and automation. “If we lose this, we do not have a… | Aaron Prather | 130 comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amprather_ford-ceo-jim-farley-returned-from-a-recent-activity-7383155351631872000-1vrq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABYo3YBpNFn3EjbVJxuiB6CdYLSNw26-uA)\n- Make Europe Great Again? — Short reflection touching on Europe, China, trade, and industrial coordination, with a linked post from LinkedIn.[[1]](Make%20Europe%20Great%20Again%2028bfc2711b808015bf18d798af40ae7e.md)\n- Världsekonomin — Notes on China’s digital renminbi, lower transaction costs, and shifting leverage from US tariffs.[[2]](Make%20Europe%20Great%20Again%2028bfc2711b808015bf18d798af40ae7e.md)\n- A lot of car companies are soon going out of business — On why many automakers may fail and how China’s integrated, agile manufacturing is a competitive edge.[[3]](Make%20Europe%20Great%20Again%2028bfc2711b808015bf18d798af40ae7e.md)\n- The Chinese long term goals — China’s long-horizon strategy to regain historical prominence via tech and economic influence.[[4]](Make%20Europe%20Great%20Again%2028bfc2711b808015bf18d798af40ae7e.md)\n- What are the problem car companies facing? — Bureaucracy and lack of critical feedback slow incumbents compared to Chinese competitors.[[5]](Make%20Europe%20Great%20Again%2028bfc2711b808015bf18d798af40ae7e.md)\n- Tech debt is not a burden - its a strategic lever for success 1 — Broader product and execution theme that can relate to speed and competitiveness.[[6]](Make%20Europe%20Great%20Again%2028bfc2711b808015bf18d798af40ae7e.md)",

Often, they’re tied to dependencies or broader organizational challenges.\n\nHere’s what matters: Risk is a language organizations understand.\n\nFinancial risks. Market risks. Compliance risks. GDPR risks. They all follow the same formula:\n\n- Identify the risk (with root cause analysis if possible).\n- Assess the possibility that the risk happens.\n- Define the potential downside.\n- Suggest an actionable solution.\n- Most importantly, be proactive.\n\nA risk can be defined as a lost opportunity for a deal or market expansion; what most would say is a Business Case way of handling prioritization with the upside instead.\n\nFear-based cultures - like Nokia’s during its decline - often avoid bad news. That approach doesn’t work. It’s better to surface risks early when there’s still time to act.\n\n**Remember:**\n\nHiding the problem might feel like the right thing to do in the short term.

These layers - portfolio, coordination, and team - organize the complexity from strategic initiatives down to daily tasks.\n\nBut why these specific layers? Let's explore their unique roles and how recognizing their characteristics can help determine if your chosen framework is truly effective or fundamentally flawed.\n\n## The Three Layers: What Each Layer Does\n\nEvery scaled knowledge work management framework includes these three layers:\n\n1. Portfolio Layer (top): Aligns projects and initiatives with your strategic goals, identifies constraints, prioritizes the projects, and ensures resources are optimally allocated to high-value projects.\n\n2. Coordination Layer (middle): Manages dependencies between projects or teams to keep deliveries synchronized and on track.\n\n3. Team Layer (bottom): Handles day-to-day tasks, ensuring smooth workflows and effective delivery of smaller work items or stories.\n\nInterestingly, these layers alternate between \"production/process\" and \"project\" characteristics. The Portfolio and Team layers are more production-oriented, whereas the Coordination layer is project-focused. Why this distinction?\n\n## Projects vs. Production: Two Types of Work in Organizations\n\nOrganizations have two fundamental types of work:\n\n- Projects (initiatives, missions): work packages with fixed sequences, strong dependencies, and high complexity and uncertainty – further on the touch time (on the longest chain) should be very near to the lead time. But therefore, higher complexity in management.\n- Production (processes, value streams): Small, interchangeable tasks with flexible sequences – requires a backlog and leads to longer waiting times and lower touch times. But therefore, it is simpler to manage.\n\nAt the Team layer, production is clearly visible - you see it in agile practices like Scrum (similar to the “boxes/space WIP limits” at the Ford’s assembly line) or Kanban (like Toyota’s just-in-time system). Similarly, the Portfolio layer also operates like production, managing multiple projects or initiatives with flexible sequences.\n\nThe Coordination layer, however, behaves like projects, due to its role in managing dependencies. Here, effective methods include Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) are used.\n\nUnderstanding this distinction is critical - it helps you choose the right management tools for each layer.\n\n### A Deeper Insight: Fractal Patterns in Layers\n\nLooking even deeper, this pattern repeats itself at other scales:\n\n- Below the Team layer, managing subtasks within a story or task involves again fixed dependencies – you have to think first how to do it, then do it, then quality check, then hand over to the next or delivery (very simple but project characteristics).\n- Above the Portfolio layer, coordinating between different programs (often between companies) or large initiatives again exhibits project-like characteristics.\n\nThis creates a repeating, fractal-like pattern, alternating production and project characteristics throughout the organizational structure.\n\n## The Evolution of Workflow Controls\n\nOver time, the workflow controls fortunately underwent some progress – here is a very rough overview of the current state of development:\n\n[](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHav8SOI3luSA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/B4EZa_OdYTHwAY-/0/1746964961597?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=TD-QHLd-Oq20rwkORWgFTmbGYpeMT28KvHcce9oXlFA)\n\nArticle content\n\nWith each generation, flexibility increases, and the amount of work-in-progress necessary to keep a steady flow is reduced. So with every generation, the lead time decreases and the throughput increases.\n\n## Tools and Methods from Theory of Constraints\n\nBesides well-known agile methods like Scrum and Kanban, TOC offers multiple elements tailored to different scenarios:\n\n- Drum Buffer Rope (DBR) – production with a real constraint\n- Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) – high-speed and high-reliability projects and portfolios\n- Reliable Scrum – high-reliable agile deliveries\n- Simplified Drum-Buffer-Rope (sDBR) – very flexible production, like queue management\n- agile Critical Chain Project Management (aCCPM) – a combination of Critical Chain for portfolio and projects, and agile on the team level\n- TameFlow Boards (aka Ultimate Scrum) – minimal WIP swim lane boards = optimal flow in agile teams\n\nThe full overview of all building blocks can be found here in \"[The TOC Lego Brick Article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/build-your-own-high-performance-framework-theory-lego-m%25C3%25BCller/?trackingId=rQ5eQjsvQJeOfWt3J31Miw%3D%3D&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block).\"\n\n## Evaluating Frameworks: Is Your Choice Effective?\n\nNow, with this understanding, you can easily evaluate your framework's effectiveness.\n\nThere are two dimensions:\n\n- Does the framework recognize the different layers and provide appropriate methods?\n- Are the methods provided efficient and of new generations?\n\nTake SAFe® and Flight Levels®/Kanban, for example:\n\n- Both use similar/same methods (Scrum and Kanban) at all three layers, ignoring each layer’s unique needs. This \"one-size-fits-all\" approach can be inefficient, like using a hammer to drive in a screw. It works, but takes extra effort, especially at the Coordination layer, where managing dependencies requires precise control.\n- SAFe® uses mainly first generation methods and compensates with cadences, a lot synchronization meetings and may new roles. Most probably not efficient.\n\nSo, a good framework recognizes the three different layers and uses different appropriate control mechanisms of the best available generation.\n\n## Comparison: How SAFe®, Flight Levels®, and the Theory of Constraints Stack\n\nSAFe® and Flight Levels® apply uniform management methods across layers, which might not match the distinct characteristics required at each layer.\n\nIn contrast, the Theory of Constraints (TOC) adapts to each layer:\n\n- Portfolio & Team Layers (Production): Uses Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR) techniques.\n- Coordination Layer (Project): Applies Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM).\n\nThe following table gives an overview, especially for project organizations:\n\n[](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQE5nZtpwwymuQ/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/B4EZa_O1r9HYAY-/0/1746965061497?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=evN0EWpzZqH1KjLvP2K7cOkXMA_ncqxlvrWYwg4nBOk)\n\nArticle content\n\nAttention: Some organizations do not have projects! These organizations have dedicated self-containing product lines with one product. Their goal is to deliver as fast as possible as cheap as possible and continuously improve in small steps. In this case the three-layer structure does not emerge.\n\nThese full product organizations are very rare and will get more rare in future because our systems get more complex over time and more collaboration company over spanning will be seen.\n\n## Conclusion: Choosing the Right Framework Matters\n\nA truly effective agile or project management framework must respect the unique characteristics of each layer, applying appropriate methods of the newest generation to manage complexity efficiently.\n\nUnfortunately, most current frameworks fail this test because they use the same method across all layers.\n\nIn contrast, the Theory of Constraints understands and utilizes the alternating fractal patterns of production and projects, applying suitable tools at every layer. The result is less management overhead and smoother, more effective delivery.\n\nNow, consider your own organization. Is your current framework working effectively, or could embracing these insights improve your outcomes?\n\nIf you would like to learn practical implementation techniques, you can visit the DolphinUniverse community.\n\nJoin the free DolphinUniverse to [stay ahead of the curve and learn more about 3rd-generation flow methods](https://dolphinuniverse.circle.so/join?invitation_token=466103edae2de06a1a0ef5b53c0f3151e4ff842f-6b1cce1f-0c6a-41e0-9fa0-61af2653dea9&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)!\n\nP.P.S.

Let me share five that might be the reason.\nNow, I could just tell you that “change is hard,” “stay patient,” and all that usual stuff… But we both know it’s about creating the right conditions.\n\nCreate a shared goal\n\n↳ Get your team to understand the common objectives. When everyone understands “why” we need to do “what”, they will be engaged.\n\nAllocate the right resources and time\n\n↳ Don’t expect change without the right support. Resources and time are critical.\n\nLeadership must communicate clearly\n\n↳ If leadership doesn’t explain “why” this change is happening, confusion will spread.\n\nSet up correct KPI:s and incentives\n\n↳ A common mistake! Current incentives might be contra-productive to the goals. Get this right!\n\nRemember: Change is 10% process and 90% people\n↳ You can change the processes, but can’t change people.\n\nAs a leader, focus on setting the vision, allocating resources, and getting the right incentives. Let your team own “how” to make it happen.\n\n---\n\nThis version removes all bolding, uses arrows and emojis, and maintains a clear, engaging flow suitable for LinkedIn.\n\nFörändring är svårt. Det du kan göra är att skapa bästa möjliga förutsättningar för dina kollegor att lyckas:\n\n1. Skapa **ett** **gemensamt mål** att samlas runt.\n2. Ledningen måste vara tydlig **varför** vi gör förändringen.\n3. Se till att förändringen har de **resurser** och tid som krävs.\n4. Ekonomistyrning och **incitament** måste stötta förändringen.\n5. Förändring är 90% människor, 10% teknik och vi kan bara **kontrollera** tekniken.\n\nGlöm inte att ledningens arbete handlar om att kommunicera det gemensamma målet och förklara varför. Hur det ska genomföras vill du låta dina medarbetare ta ansvar för.\n\nVad är det viktigaste enligt dig när det kommer till att skapa rätt förutsättningar till en förändring?\n\nFörändringsledning och ekonomistyrning. PNL inte prestera. Även ekonomistyrning.\n\nHur jobbar man med att prioritera tillsammans med PNL. Resultatställen överallt.\n\nSilotänk och suboptimering. Olika mål.\n\nChange Frustration\n\nFörändringsfrustration\n\nVarför händer inte förändring?\n\nFörväntningarn\n\nDe fem vanligaste misstagen!",

A CTV (value) typically covers the end goal:\n\n“Become a better writer in 90 days”\n\nAction vs. transformation.\n\nThis \"problem\" is most noticeable in the endings or P.S. sections of the posts you see in your feed.\n\nA few more examples:\n\n\"Optimize your profile\" → \"Get leads on autopilot\"\n\n\"Download PDF\" → \"Start your workout plan\"\n\n\"Repost\" → \"Teach others something new\"\n\n(a combo of the above works well too)\n\nIn a nutshell...\n\nDon't tell them \"how to stop being a beginner\".\n\n↳ Tell them \"how to start being a pro\".\n\n#Chase Dimond\n\n![Untitled](Speach%20write/Untitled.png)\n\nWEBINAR: Fokus 🎯 på kundens framtida problem\n\nVill du skapa de bästa förutsättningar för en långsiktig hållbar organisation genom rätt fokus?\n\nDet innehåller tre saker:\n\n1. Fokusera på vad som är viktigast för kunden: Me, I and myself.\n2. Du behöver förklara att du förstår kundens riktiga problem.\n3. Berätta hur kundens liv blir bättre genom din vision att lösa problemet.\n\nDen här resan vill dina kunder (och medarbetare) vara med på.\n\nDet är vad mitt kommande webinar handlar om. Skriv “relevant” nedan 👇 så får du en länk!\n\nVälkommen på mitt webinarium som handlar hur du sätter fokus 🎯 på kundens riktiga problem i din vision, ditt syfte och de beslut du behöver ta, för att framtidssäkra din organisation.\n\nVill du med? Skriv “Relevant” nedan. Vi håller på mellan 0830-0900 den 15 november.\n\nJag är övertygad att du i din roll kommer ta med dig några användbara tips att arbeta vidare. Det blir bland annat:\n\n✅ Att förstå varför så många organisationer, kanske även din egen, fastnar i att lösa fel problem.\n\n✅ Hur du kliver in i rollen som problemägare och verkligen förstår kundens underliggande utmaningar och inte ger dig förrän problemet är löst.\n\n✅ Vikten av direktkommunikation med kunder, utan antaganden och sluta killgissa.\n\nHar skrivit en bok som heter Relevant där jag samlat de senaste årens frustration i att inte fokusera på det som egentligen är betydelsefullt. Att lösa kundernas riktiga problem.\n\nVill du med? Skriv “Relevant” nedan. Om du dessutom taggar en kompis så är du med i utlottningen av några böcker.\n\nFormatting your LinkedIn posts matters A LOT.\n\n(so here's my mini-masterclass for you)\n\nHow people \"read\" is how they \"understand\".\n\nA well-written post = great message\n\nA well-formatted post = great readability\n\nBest of both worlds = great for understanding\n\nThat being said...\n\nLet's dive into 5 areas of textual formatting.\n\n1. Listicles\n\n1. Use listicles to explain \"steps\"\n\n2. Use numbers → not bulletpoints\n\n3. Write your lists with one-liners only\n\n4. Don't add any white space to your list\n\n5. Make sure every item in the list is \"clear\"\n\n6. My magic number for listicles is number 7\n\n7. Try to format the list items by length → TRY\n\n2. Listicles with examples\n\n1. Write every item in the list as a two-liner\n\n↳ \"The second line should be your example\"\n\n3. Paragraphs\n\nNever write paragraphs longer than 3 lines.\n\nTry to put short sentences in clusters of 3 too.\n\nIf your list is not numbered, keep it under 3 lines too.\n\n4. Hooks\n\nWrite every hook as a 1-liner. Always.\n\nHooks longer than 1 line perform 20% worse.\n\nHooks with \"negative\" words perform 30% worse.\n\n(Those are my stats based on my own 500+ posts)\n\n5. Post endings\n\nKeep your summary / closing statement to under 3 lines. Or 1 paragraph (like the one you're reading).\n\nIdeally, write just 1 line.\n\nLook...\n\nYour LinkedIn posts \"need\" to be read.\n\nFormatting isn't \"magic\". But it is the \"sauce\".\n\nYour readability directly impacts your message.\n\nMake it easy to read → it'll be easy to understand.\n\nThanks for coming to my masterclass. ✌️\n\nRepost if useful ♻️\n\nP.S. How much attention do you pay to formatting?\n\n[PAS](Speach%20write/PAS%204219cb49be394884bce77c8af4f38374.md)\n\n[Jasmin Alić på LinkedIn: This 1 LinkedIn rule changed everything for me: Everything I share → it… | 1 175 kommentarer](Speach%20write/Jasmin%20Ali%C4%87%20p%C3%A5%20LinkedIn%20This%201%20LinkedIn%20rule%20chang%2057cb775faa6745d98a76947eb3c1c99f.md)\n\n[Speaking](Speach%20write/Speaking%20225193dbd6474657bcc1371e7e54f179.md)\n\nI start every post with:\n\n\"Dear son,\"\n\nand end with:\n\n\"Love, Dad\"\n\nAfter I'm done, I just delete those 2 parts.\n\nFor you, it could be a friend, mentor, or client.\n\nBut you will 100% save time when you're writing.\n\nAnd you will 100% find the best words every time.\n\nPut yourself \"at ease\" when you write.\n\n↳ Your audience will read with ease too!",

Problem**\n\nThe first step is to identify your reader’s problem. What pain point are they trying to solve?\n\nThis is where you need to do your research so that you fully understand their challenges.\n\nOnly then can you craft a message that resonates with them.\n\nFor example, let’s say you’re selling a new type of toothbrush that’s designed to remove plaque more effectively than traditional toothbrushes.\n\nYour potential customers might not even know that plaque is a problem.\n\nSo part of your job is to educate them about the issue and make them aware of the potential consequences if they don’t take action.\n\n### **2. Agitation**\n\nOnce you’ve identified the problem, it’s time to agitate it so your reader understands the full extent of the issue.\n\nThis is where you need to be careful not to come across as too sales-y or pushy. The goal is simply to get them to realize that this is a problem worth solving.\n\nFor example, let’s say plaque can lead to gum disease, which can lead to tooth loss.\n\nIf that’s not enough to get them interested in your product, you could also mention that gum disease has been linked to other health problems like heart disease and stroke.\n\n### **3. Solution**\n\nFinally, you need to offer a solution to the problem.\n\nThis is where you introduce your product or service and explain how it can help solve their specific challenge.\n\nBe sure to focus on the benefits rather than the features so that your reader can easily see how your solution will make their life better.\n\nIn our toothbrush example, you might talk about how your product removes plaque more effectively than traditional toothbrushes, making it easier for them to keep their teeth healthy and avoid gum disease.\n\nYou could also mention that it’s gentle on sensitive gums and comes with a money-back satisfaction guarantee.",

Target 2030) till konkreta prioriteringar och planer.\n2. **Kopplar dessa planer till förmågor**, med tydliga kontrakt, ansvar och flöden mellan dem.\n3. **Standardiserar arbetssätt** via playbooks, assessments och gemensamma principer.\n4. **Mäter och förbättrar resultatet** kontinuerligt – genom KPI:er, automatisering och lärande.\n\n---\n\n### **Resultatet av modellen**\n\n- Ett **styrbart nav** för hur verksamheten fungerar i praktiken (PMO, processer, IT, management).\n- **Kontrakt och gränssnitt** mellan affär, IT och stödprocesser.\n- En **mätbar koppling mellan kundvärde, dataflöde och interna förmågor**.\n- Ett underlag för **kontinuerliga förbättringar och automation** mot långsiktiga mål (2030).\n\n![IMG_0580.png](Fr%C3%A5n%20WS%20med%20Tom%20Jenkins/IMG_0580.png)\n\n| **Del** | **Rubrik** | **Innehåll / Syfte** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **1** | PLAN | Kapabilitetsprioritering, styrning, mål och roadmap. |\n| **2** | MANAGEMENT / PMO | Koordinera och driva förändringsplaner. |\n| **3** | TRANSFORMATION PLAN | Kopplar nuläge till målbild (2030). |\n| **4** | OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES | Definierar hur organisationen arbetar – kontrakt, flöden, data. |\n| **5** | CONTRACT FLOW | Definierar ansvar mellan funktioner (kundintegration, finans, API). |\n| **6** | PLAYBOOK & ASSESSMENT | Standarder, mätningar, och målbild per förmåga. |\n| **7** | OUTPUT / UT | Förbättringar, automation, kontinuerlig utveckling av förmågor. |\n\n## **Översikt: Operativa modeller**\n\nTavlan verkar visa ett flöde från **strategi och planering (vänster)** → **utförande och styrning (mitten)** → **påverkan på förmågor och resultat (höger)**.\n\nTemat är att skapa en **operativ modell** som länkar **ledningens prioriteringar** till **kontrakt, processer och KPI:er** – och vidare till **förbättringar och automation**.\n\n---\n\n## **Vänster sida: PLAN och Managementstruktur**\n\n### **Rubriker / Begrepp**\n\n- **PLAN**\n- **Cap Priorities**\n- **Management Dept**\n- **Transformation Plan**\n- **PMO**\n- **CEO**\n- **IT / Operations**\n- **TODAY → THEN**\n- **TARGET 2030**\n- **Execution Framework**\n- **TEAM**\n- **#WoW – Sourcing and Internal Contracts**\n\n### **Innehåll / Tolkning**\n\n1. **PLAN / Cap Priorities**\n    - Startpunkt för det operativa arbetet.\n    - Fokus på **kapabilitetsprioritering** (Cap priorities) som kopplas till verksamhetsmål.\n    - Pilar visar flödet från strategi till exekvering.\n2. **Management Dept**\n    - En struktur med olika nivåer: “CEO → Management Dept → PMO → IT”.\n    - Kanske beskriver rollerna som ansvarar för plan, styrning och leverans.\n    - På tavlan syns även “Con.” och “On.” vilket kan vara *Continuous* / *Ongoing* arbete.\n3. **Transformation Plan / PMO**\n    - PMO (Project Management Office) verkar bära ansvaret för att driva **transformationsplanen**.\n    - “Transformation Plan” länkas till “Execution Framework”.\n    - Möjligen ett programkontor som koordinerar olika initiativ.\n4. **Then / Now**\n    - “Today → Then” visar förflyttningen mellan nuläge och mål.\n    - “Target 2030” visar en långsiktig vision.\n    - “Execution Framework / Team” visar organisationens operativa motor.\n5. **WoW**\n    - Står sannolikt för **Ways of Working**.\n    - Anteckningen “Sourcing and internal contracts” tyder på att man vill skapa interna avtal eller kontrakt mellan förmågor och funktioner.\n\n---\n\n## **Mitten: Operativa principer och flöde**\n\n### **Rubriker / Begrepp**\n\n- **Operational Principles (OR. PRINCIPLES)**\n- **Contract / Flow**\n- **New Customer Integration**\n- **Main KPI**\n- **SAP / CRM**\n- **Finance / Invoicing**\n- **Contract / CLA**\n- **VFT (Value Flow Transformation?)**\n- **Playbook**\n- **Assessment**\n- **BC = Future State?**\n\n### **Innehåll / Tolkning**\n\n1. **Operational Principles**\n    - Grunder för hur man vill styra och arbeta.\n    - Pilar mot “Contract” och “Flow” tyder på att principerna leder till formaliserade gränssnitt mellan enheter.\n2. **Contract / Flow**\n    - Ett kontraktsbaserat arbetssätt mellan olika förmågor (möjligen Business Capability Contracts).\n    - Skapar ansvar och tydlighet i dataflöden och prestationer.\n3. **New Customer Integration**\n    - Exempel på ett operativt flöde.\n    - Input: data och krav från kund (SAP, CRM)\n    - Output: integration via API, e-mail, möten.\n4. **Playbook / Assessment**\n    - Standardiserade arbetssätt.\n    - “Assessment” mäter mognad eller kvalitet.\n    - “BC = Future State” visar att detta leder till en framtida målbild för förmågan.\n\n---\n\n## **Höger sida: Utflöde och påverkan på förmågor**\n\n### **Rubriker / Begrepp**\n\n- **UT**\n- **CAD Improvements**\n- **C.I.**\n- **Automation App.**\n- **2030 Goal**\n\n### **Innehåll / Tolkning**\n\n1. **UT**\n    - Utdata eller effekter från det operativa flödet.\n    - Leder till förbättringar inom förmågor.\n2. **CAD Improvements**\n    - Möjligen syftar på **Capability and Delivery Improvements** (inte CAD som i ritning).\n    - Alltså förbättring av förmågor baserat på analys av flöden och kontrakt.\n3. **C.I.**\n    - Står sannolikt för **Continuous Improvement**.\n    - Pilar mot framtiden visar ett iterativt förbättringsflöde.\n4. **Automation App**\n    - Automatisering av processer som mål.\n    - Ligger nära 2030-visionen och kopplar till IT.",
